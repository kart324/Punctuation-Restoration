good morning a bunch of folks asked me to make one of these a day in the life videos to talk about how i do time management the day how i structure the routine to maximize productivity so here we go the day starts now after about six to eight hours of sleep now there's periods of my life where i do sprints where i'll pull all nighters work crazy hours and so on but regularly i try to get 68 hours of sleep plus the mythical epic 30 minute power nap i think sleep diet and exercise are essential for productivity just under i would say passion and whatever the heck you need to do to be happy and keep every single day low stress i might give a shout out to a few products that sponsor the podcast for no reason except that i love using them and that's why we agreed for them to sponsor the podcast so click their links in the description to support the videos i make i'm really fortunate to have way more sponsors that i need so i get to choose only the ones i really love i'm generally a minimalist guy i don't like material possessions but this ac bed has been nice it lets you set the temperature throughout the night so for me what i like is for it to cool the bed and then warms up as i wake up been helping me get some restful sleep so i start each day when i get out of bed the first thing there's a mantra a list that i have on a sheet of paper that i go through so i start by reminding myself of the current set of rules and constraints on the various addictions things that drain on my time so that includes social media the current rule is i only check social media when i post which is one two or three times a day for no more than 10 minutes so that that's it it's very strict that's one of the main addictions i think that's important to control some people completely remove themselves from social media i think that's one of the possible solutions but to me that's a little bit of an easy way out the hardest thing to do is to really moderate the use of social media because when you use it in moderation actually can bring you joy it can really connect you with other people it kind of makes me feel amazing when i only check it once or twice a day but you have to be strict and then the other rules are diet and exercise so i make sure i exercise every single day no matter what even if injured i find a body part any body part that's not injured and exercise it and then diet i just have a straight diet that i follow within the constraints of which i can enjoy myself so for me that's been keto which is very low carb diet so the first part of the mantra is i remind myself of those rules it kind of sets the constraints within which the game is to be played second part of the mantra is gratitude i visualize and meditate on the idea that i might die today at any moment today so i kind of try to accept the notion that today is my last day in this earth and it's mostly just a breathe in and out and a pause and a meditation on the fact that it's freaking amazing that i'm alive that life is amazing third is i list out loud by the way unless i'm with somebody then it's in my head but i list a set of goals for the next five years a set of goals that i have and these are ambitious big goals that i would like to achieve in the next five years fourth is i list more near-term goals for me that's by the end of 2020 i want to do these kinds of things they're just out of reach but achievable so if i really work my ass off and with a bit of luck i can get it done i mean that really starts to get me amped up like let's let's get to work fifth part of the mantra zooming in even further i actually focus in on the day i visualize going through the rest of the day all the things i think i need to get done this is really quick but i literally visualize myself like in a game of slims like on fast forward running around getting all the stuff done successfully like i visualize both the struggle of it i visualize the hardest part of the day that i i have on my to-do list and getting them done crushing it but really sort of uh focusing on the the timing of it the beat of the day and getting it all done just like a game of sims except for the part where when you're cooking you set yourself on fire you run around i miss sims i miss video games in general finally i go through a set of principles that i strive to live up to as a man now there's a particular set of phrases that are a little bit cliche but i think fundamental to who i am but they center around compassion empathy love and on the other side of it is character and integrity and strength both physical and mental so today is a little bit different because i'm also making this video i don't like it it's uncomfortable it's a distraction it takes away from my focus but i'm gonna get the job done i said i'm gonna do it i'll do it so i'm gonna do the mantra now and next thing hit hard the deepest work of the day for four hours a four hour session that i'll probably feel behind the desk all right so i did the mantra then i drank about a liter water went to the bathroom made a coffee and now ready to hit the day hard with a four hour session of deep work focused on a single thing no interruptions if interesting ideas come into my head to try to trick me into pulling on the thread of that idea i gently set it aside write it down in google doc to address later so i bring my mind gently back to the focus of the task because ideas keep coming but you really want to focus on the task so the only interruptions that are allowed is water coffee bathroom and i try to minimize those i usually try to be just once in a four hour session i stop the timer when i take that break but i don't do anything during that break like social media or any of that stuff it's really my mind is still focused on the task at hand and hitting it hard when i return to the desk the desk by the way is a standing desk they don't sponsor anything but i still love them it's autonomous you should check it out pretty inexpensive sometimes i sit sometimes i stand not wearing a suit i sometimes wear a suit especially i'm going to film i wear a suit when i go outside i just enjoy the way i feel when i wear a suit but at home i'm wearing a t-shirt and jeans right now i'm not wearing any pants just kidding i'm wearing jeans but uh you wouldn't know it if i didn't which is the magic of the internet if you punish it i can do a separate video on my setup i optimize the heck out of everything but my first love my home is the kinesis keyboard it's this weird ergonomic keyboard that's probably way too expensive but i still love it i'm surrounded by things i love and emacs editor although i use a lot of modern ids like today i'm working on tensorflow lite on a samsung galaxy s20 doing some deep learning on the smartphone there's a bunch of tricky undocumented things that i'm trying to accomplish not looking forward to it because it's going to be just a lot of debugging and trying to figure out obscure things but that's the hardest part of the day that's the hardest thing on my to-do list that's what i'm going to focus on no distractions that's what this four-hour session is about i'm usually drained but happy at the end of the session i mean i'm happy throughout but i kind of dread this four hour session every day which is why i hit it hard early on without reflecting without thinking almost like a machine i just get the job done that's the way i think about it and i feel good afterwards but i don't want to do it and i do it anyway so here we go i'll see on the other end of the four hours all right the four-hour session is done i did not get as much done as i wanted but it's nevertheless a big success because i just grinded it out zero thoughts about anything else only took a single uh bathroom and water break so it took about four hours and ten minutes next up i'm going to do a little bit social media now which i need to post a podcast conversation with david eagleman brilliant neuroscientist so i'm just going to post that check the comments from the previous day trying to keep the whole experience under 5 minutes and definitely under 10 minutes and after that like i do every single day no exception is guitar or piano or music usually these days it's been guitar in the human world i'm currently single but in the music world i'm in an open relationship with this beautiful guitar open relationship because i sometimes cheat on her with the acoustic but mostly electric fender strat the warm boozy sound of offender kind of like the eric clapton jimi hendrix as uh brings joy to my heart so i look forward to this moment it's an escape it just uh makes me happy like a lot of things do but this is kind of a private moment of joy and after that is about an hour and a half to two hours of a private set of moments of suffering aka exercise so here we go social media guitar keep the social media under 10 minutes no exceptions and the guitar sometimes i'll let it slip but usually just 20 minutes all right got the social media and the guitar done actually there was a a bunch of moments where just brought a smile to my face both the hilarity and the love i always really appreciate it when i check social media moderation it really does bring me joy so thank you for that now it's time to face the demons in my mind going on a long run all the things i don't want to think about i usually start out listening to brown noise as i run it really focuses my mind lets me think deeply and then about 2-3 miles into the run when i start feeling a little better i'll switch to listening to an audio book i'm currently listening to the rise and fall of the third reich recommended highly great book rough but important for our times if you don't study history you're doomed to repeat it my current exercise routine is around a minimum of six miles every day and then when i'm about three or four miles in i decide how far more i want to go i usually don't feel like running but once i actually get out there want to say put some of the miles in you start feeling good sometimes uh sometimes not sometimes it's the drag but sometimes you feel really good and then i'll do the 8 10 maybe even 12 miles my hope one day is i'll just keep running and do an ultra marathon just on a whim now for the usual 67 mile run it should take about an hour and afterwards i do a short but intense session of body weight exercises after the whole crazy push-up pull-up squat challenge that i did i now do the david goggins inspired nickel and dime workout that he talks about so every single minute you do five pull-ups and ten push-ups a minute on a minute and usually it kicks my ass to do about 15 to 20 minutes of that that's enough my hope one day is to get up to like one hour which is really tough your muscles just drained exhausted but i find it's a really great intense way to get the exercise in without taking too much away from your day heart on the mind hard on the body but good for the soul by the way all this has fasted so it's been about 14 16 hours since i've eaten last i feel great no food water and i've just taken a salt pill in case i do run for a long time it's important to have electrolytes in the body i love exercising fasted an empty stomach focuses the mind i can actually perform extremely well that's one of the things i've learned about myself everybody's different but i've actually learned for like martial arts for combat sports for intense workouts even i just personally enjoy working out fasted so i guess based on my diet but also my psychology i perform best when i'm fat adapted which means i'm a low carb diet it's probably deep somewhere in my eastern european genetics that my ancestors will go without food for long periods of time and then have to wrestle a bear to the death intensely so it seems like this is the kind of thing i enjoy doing not eating and then doing intense focused hard workouts makes me feel great i enjoy it both physically and mentally all right let's get to work all right the exercise grind for the day is done i did seven miles in just over an hour i think it's slow pace really losing myself in the audiobook to be honest and after that i did 20 nickel and dimes that's 20 minutes every minute you do 10 push-ups and 5 pull-ups it's a great quick way to exhaust the muscle also really good test of mental toughness because at least for me at least at home i really want to start quitting at about the 10 to 15 minute mark just the muscles are exhausted you have to pause it's just unpleasant takes me back to the to the month and a half previously that was doing the insane uh challenge so i love it it's really quick 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes depending on the day and the one hour of the running feel pretty good not so good about 1936 1937 uh nazi germany as the audiobook is covering but uh um yeah really makes me think about the nature of evil it puts everything into puts everything else into context somehow you know studying history sometimes is a really good way to force me to stop and to acknowledge how weak my mind is and how much stronger it needs to be if i want to have a role in this world of making positive change i think about nazi germany and what it means to be a hero in those times what it means to uh be a person that can reverse the decline into evil i think it's much more difficult than people realize i think it means standing against the masses it requires a kind of mental toughness mental fortitude that i don't think i'm ready for and i need to be most likely hopefully i will never have to play a role of any importance but if i do have that opportunity i need to be able to step up that's what studying the 30s the great depression on the united states side and a decline into a state of terror on the european side really makes me think i know this is a day in the life video but uh that's also my days i as often as possible try to think deeply about history about the state of the world today about my own mind about the science that i'm fascinated with which is the science of intelligence and the science of engineering intelligence after the exercise when i jump into the shower which contains the moment of the day that i dread the most which is the first minute that i take a cold shower i have a bunch of songs that i know the one minute mark of that i usually put on it could be as cliche and cheesy as uh the rocky soundtrack we're gonna fly now i think it's the the first solo is the one minute mark or uh fortunate son by ccr or uh if i really need a boost i'm an old school metallica fan as well so master puppets i think when he starts singing is the one minute mark so here we go and after that i'm right back into the grind of deep work another four hour session of where i continue on a particular task focused for four hours straight today i didn't get as much done on the tensorflow light side so i'm gonna probably dive right back in but usually during the shower and a little bit afterwards i'm thinking about like what's the right thing to be focusing on given what i was able to get done in the first four hour session all right next fun time is over we're back to the grind of uh deep work the second four hour session of the day where i remove the rest of the world and focus on a single task today i'm going to continue with the tensorflow lite work on the galaxy s20 for the probably entire idea of the four-hour session now depending on the day i might eat here if i'm eating twice a day today i don't really feel like it really focused really feeling good again that's kind of the benefits of the whole intermittent fasting keto that sometimes you just don't feel like eating you feel great so i'm going to eat just one meal today which will be after this four hour session and i see this as a kind of sprint to the finish because the eight hours in total of the work is really what i aim to do every single day the rest of the stuff there'll be another four hour session but it's often more relaxed more all over the place has a few more distractions a little bit more fun and chaos and just all over the place these two four hour sessions of deep work is really what my day is centered around so everything is about them this is where that war of art the battle for focus for gaining focus and holding on to focus that's what it's all about some days are really rough the first session today was easy i found the focus pretty quickly and just stay with it part of it is because it's kind of a new activity it's a new phone i'm playing with and also doing a different kind of experiment with tensorflow lite so it's new it really pulls at you and even though it was difficult there was no serious stumbling blocks like i didn't have to spend a lot of time debugging code and so on so it was easy let's see what the second four hour session is sometimes it's a grind but no matter what the focus is always just to be present to be there if nothing's working it's not happening i still stay in that place and wait for the breakthrough and the breakthrough always comes everybody's different i think of how they discover focus inspiration motivation but i'm a big believer in the discipline of ritual so being there and even if you don't feel like it still being there even if progress is not being made still being there for the grind because sometimes just minutes later there will be a breakthrough that's how i feel about deep work that's how i feel about running too just taking it one step at a time because some minutes are rough and others are full of bliss and that's just the way the journey of hard work the journey of doing anything difficult i'll see you on the other end of the four hours now the two big battles of the day are done the two four hour sessions of deep work time to break the fast i break the fast with athletic greens i sponsor the podcast but actually an amazing thing that i love whether their sponsor or not it covers all the bases that i need with the kind of restricted keto diet that i have it has all the things that a multivitamin has but a ton of other nutrients as well i don't know what it looks like to you but it's actually pretty delicious i look forward to it and it just makes me feel good in case it's interesting what i usually eat is some kind of meat and some kind of vegetable so if i eat once a day that's going to be about two pounds of meat a total of 1800 calories 2 000 calories for the total meal if i'm not being very fancy it's gonna be ground beef like this is grass-fed organic eighty-five percent so 15 fat ground beef in terms of keto it results in a good macro breakdown in terms of taste i just like it in terms of cooking it's also easier because it's just the right amount of fat when it's mixed with the vegetables it like it creates a non-sticky pan situation where i don't have to add any oil it just mixes nicely and results in flavorful veggies so veggies my favorite go-to is probably cauliflower not always when i really want to get crazy and party i go with carrots that's my that's my party vegetable my uh ground floor the place i return to often my home is cauliflower heat broccoli though love cauliflower and hate broccoli you know in this politically divisive world we have to pick our sides my side is with cauliflower against broccoli what else so if i'm fasting or not on the keto diet it's important to uh get electrolytes this is weird this is for long distance running this is just sodium pills i think one gram one thousand milligrams of sodium in pill form then there's magnesium glycinate when i first started keto i think i was getting headaches for the first few days to the keto flu that people talk about the salt is what curated for me is was the magnesium there's a bunch of ways to get potassium uh i take it in pill form that's really just to be careful to make sure you get enough electrolytes in your diet especially while i'm fasting especially when i'm doing a lot of exercise to balance with the water and everything like that finally i always take fish oil did not plan i'm mentioning another sponsor but i will public goods they sell a bunch of different kinds of stuff including fish oil it's all good i love the minimalist design of public good stuff anyway so much of nutrition science is uh barely a science really i like to just listen to my own body and do one person one subject scientific experiments of what makes me feel good that's how i discovered the keto diet you know i just look at the signs to make sure it's not unhealthy and it's not and for the rest of it i just see what my energy level is like how i feel throughout the day in terms of mental performance in terms of physical performance all that kind of stuff same with the nutrients it's pretty minimalist so i do take stuff if i miss days where i don't take electrolytes or fish oil it doesn't really matter but i feel good but i find it's nice to make sure you're getting all the nutrients at least regularly and like i said athletic greens help make sure i cover all bases about all the weird stuff that i should be getting and i'm not even aware of so this might be the first and only video i'll ever make in the kitchen i kind of feel like this is one of those chef shows where i should be yelling at somebody about their mediocre performance in the kitchen so i throw the veggies into boiling water then drain the water then throw in the meat and then i guess broil it or whatever the heck the term is the entire thing takes about 20 minutes but i only really participate in the last five minutes when i like when it's broiling and i mix it and sorry if broiling's not the right term i don't know what i'm doing okay anyway it's uh super easy i enjoy it it's delicious i throw some salt based spices in there and the final result kind of tastes amazing makes me happy after i make the meal i'll probably overlay the video of what the final result looks like i'll often eat it behind the desk sort of uh thinking deeply about something oftentimes about the thing i'm going to do in the next four hour session just kind of relaxing enjoying the food but also just thinking of course if there's somebody else here with me i'll be enjoying uh the meal with them there's nothing more beautiful than connecting with other human beings over some delicious food okay here we go all right i'm done eating feeling pretty good don't feel like being on video but uh by the way wearing a 2001 space odyssey shirt this is where i might be wearing a suit if i'm doing filming if i just feel like it so the next four hour session is more relaxed kind of work it's still really focused but there's a bunch of tasks this is where i might do the email check now my rule with email i check email most three times a day and the first two times is just to check for emergencies or respond to an email that takes like less than 30 seconds to respond to and it's kind of important the third session which is during this four hour period is when i actually spend try to spend no more than an hour but i go through the emails i read them these days i'm so freaking lucky to be getting just a lot of kind thoughtful messages so i just take them in it brings me joy brings a smile to my face one of the favorite things of the day for me and i also if there's like some of the stuff i have to deal with i respond to those emails that's actually at the end of the four hour session now i would also be doing video editing any kind of filming i'm doing any kind of website design stuff and also the the continuation of the deep work so today i didn't finish the tensorflow lite thing but i'm close so i'm gonna probably spend one hour on doing some more tensorflow then i'm gonna do two hours for a video editing a podcast i need to be working on i usually try to put in an hour to a day of podcast related stuff i need to outsource it i really do but for now i'm doing it and then the last hour would be the checking the email and so on and after those four hours i do two plus hours of reading one hour paper one hour plus of literature but we'll get to that first is four hours i'm back to it tensorflow for an hour two hours of podcast editing and then one hour of email again very few distractions very few breaks on days like today when i'm feeling really good really energetic this third four hour session i try to make as good as the first two in terms of the deep focus that i achieve also this time is for when i don't feel great i can just lay down and watch some netflix watch some documentaries on youtube hang out with friends if i had a girlfriend this would be girlfriend time netflix and chill for now i'm doing just the netflix part of that anyway today is deep work but starting now on any particular day this is where the possibilities of chaos are wide open so i can just do whatever the hell i want i got some jack daniels i got some stoli smirnoff vodka i got some peanut butter flavored whiskey so i don't drink very often pretty rarely actually but the possibility is always there the night is always full of possibilities i'm a big fan of a random adventure and just being lost in it this is the time for that to happen but today as far as i know it's tensorflow adobe premiere some email then some papers and some dostoyevsky let's go all right i got the four hour session done took just a few minutes longer i got all the email done i got uh podcast editing and actually just got that done in just over an hour so i had some time to do podcast prep where i'm doing some research for a couple of upcoming conversations and of course the tensorflow thing still didn't wrap it up but put it in the hour that's on the play for tomorrow to start again programming is a grind what are you gonna do but i feel really good i really feel good about the day i don't know if this is good a day in the life video but it's a good day in my life maybe not exactly in the sense that it all went perfectly but in the sense that i put in a very large number of hours of deep focus i resisted the urge to become distracted i resisted all of the usual urges i mean that's a daily fight and i want it today but it's not over so next i'm gonna do one hour of paper reading i have a whole system of papers i read there is every single day i read at least one paper today i'm skimming two machine learning type neuroscience papers that uh somebody suggested to me based on the mad both innate conversation and then i'm also doing a deeper read still this is the second session of it for the gpt3 paper i'm thinking of making a couple videos on gpt3 and just making sure i get all the details right there's there's a bunch of open questions that are not yet understood about gbt3 i think and one of the things i do when i read papers is think think outside of what the word is just saying there's obviously all kinds of different papers the ones i'm reading today both the neuroscience side and gpt3 are very easy to understand and it's more like a canvas on which you can project your ideas so you're taking in the approach the different architecture the the results you know understanding the different plots the intuitions like the different perspectives and the results but all that is like very literary like a single pass of that paper is almost enough at least so far but what the whole purpose of the process is for me reading a paper like that is to think deeply beyond the paper to think what are the deep questions to ask and that's what i do with paper reading again i have a whole system that's maybe for another video if anyone gives a damn that hour is usually pretty painful so i usually keep it to an hour like i literally sometimes i'm counting down to when i reach an hour because it's kind of hard work it really requires focus after that is a little bit more fun reading it's non-fiction or fiction depending right now i'm working through the major novels of dostoyevsky because i'm going to be talking to tolstoy dostoevsky check off translators i don't know when exactly but in a few months maybe in a month i'll be going to paris to talk to them so i'm re-reading dostoevsky i finished the idiot i'm not working through crime and punishment reading it in english but i'm also going to try to get to listening to it in russian like taking it in both languages and trying to understand the music of the different languages and how they interact how they connect what is the gap what are the things that are lost in translation that kind of thing sometimes i do it at the desk sometimes i do it on the bed going back and forth when i have a lot of energy like i do now got a little bit of coffee in me i'll just chill on the bed and read the papers and the books when i'm starting to get a little bit tired i'll jump over to the desk and back and forth so that's it i think i'll wrap up the dana life video here because i'll do the one hour paper reading and then the one hour dostoevsky and after that jump into bed and drift into sleep while continuing to read the dostoevsky but actually after the hour of literature reading i always take a pause and do the part of the mantra that i do in the morning that's gratitude again it's being thankful that i'm alive that i survived another day looking forward to the next day just be grateful for all of the moments that are full of joy in the day i mean just even filming this silly thing it's like fun there's a piece of technology that somehow is capturing this that other people might watch and then there's like a microphone i mean just the entirety of the technology everything is magical everything is magical reminding myself of that doesn't take much effort but just taking a break taking a pause just breathing and just saying damn it's good to be alive because uh i won't always be alive the ride ends too quickly so it's a opportunity a moment to uh appreciate the entirety of it i hope this video is uh interesting or useful to somebody i value a few things in this world one of them is hard work and i try to live by that every day and the other as i often always maybe too much talk about is love and compassion towards other people so with those two things it's one hell of a good life so i hope that comes through through uh the way i live my day this silly video and uh if you enjoy it subscribe support the kind folks that for some crazy reason want to sponsor the podcast that i make the podcast just uh brings me a lot of joy especially the people i get to meet the people i get to talk to on the podcast but also the community of people who listen to podcasts i'm a huge fan of podcast myself so this is just a big gift to be a part of that and the sponsors support that whole effort and they create awesome stuff so i get to enjoy and share my love for the awesome stuff they create and as a byproduct of that they enable me to have enough food and shelter to continue doing these podcasts which is fundamentally a side gig for me to the main dream the main effort that i'm still quietly putting in the hours on again thanks for watching and in your own life make sure you work hard and put a little bit of love out there in the world you
