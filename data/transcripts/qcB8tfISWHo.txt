i mean don't don't quote me on that but well i guess you are going to quote me on that but i'm hopeful [Music] hi i'm stefan my friends call me steve and this is the quantum podcast where i plan on interviewing the leading experts and thought leaders in quantum computing and in my very first episode i'm joined by amir abbas from ibm research zurich emira you have you've been invited to a gazillion of talks and workshops where you've shared your passion for quantum machine learning you're also very active on social media we help bring awareness to this fascinating field you're also a successful researcher you're doing a phd and just recently you've published a new publication on the power of quantum neural networks together with alessio figalli the fields medalist from 2018 and this summer you were a research intern at ibm research zurich you've now transitioned into a full-time role with ibm and just a couple of months ago you've won the extremely prestigious google phd fellowship so amir thank you so much for taking your time and welcome to the podcast thanks for having me i'm really excited to be here it was a very nice kind introduction thanks all right so let's get into it um before we we talk about quantum computing and machine learning and all of this exciting stuff i think we can start off with kind of your background i think i think it's very unique and so you did a undergraduate degree in business science then you've worked for a couple of years in a variety of roles and then you've gone back into academia to do a master's and now you've kind of risen up to quantum stardom within a couple of years so how did that happen yeah it's um it is i guess quite an unusual uh journey so as a kid i always knew that the one thing that i loved very much was was mathematics and but i didn't know what to study i didn't know what i could do with this so i did a general kind of degree in finance something called actuarial science because i heard that there's a lot of math in this and then you can also get a reasonably good job once you're done and so i think i followed like a very traditional path in that i did that and then i went on to to work but i also found like coding really interesting when i was doing my undergraduate degree so i wanted to still like do a lot of programming and then this also led me to discover things like data science and machine learning which i think was relatively new when i was just finishing up my undergraduate degree so i i looked for roles that kind of incorporated these two things finance and data science and so i started working in asset management and doing some research there and it was really great i learned a lot but um i always felt like something was missing something was um not fulfilling me and i didn't know why until i found physics and i used to watch a lot of youtube videos and and then when i came across this idea of quantum computing and quantum physics it was just like it combined everything that i i loved right everything that i was interested in and i started youtubing stuff and reading and and really getting into it and then i realized okay my career path needs to change because this is the thing that i'm clearly passionate about and so i wrote to um a lot of professors in my country so in south africa i just wrote to all these physics professors that i could find online and i said these are the skills i have who will um who will take me as a student and francesco petruccini from the university of quezon hotel wrote back and he said come and meet me i flew to devon i think i was working in johannesburg i flew to durvan the week after and we met and i think you know he he took a little bit of a risk on me i think because i'm you know i had no physics at all background but i promised that i would prove myself to him and um so this this yeah i'm very grateful for this to have this opportunity and from there the rest was history right so then i fell in love with quantum computing i fell in love with quantum machine learning and i'm just very happy to be in something now that i really truly care about that's really like a hero's journey basically i don't see it that way so yeah and um when i first did finance when you were working there oh sorry i think there's like a lag in our in our connection when i first when i first did it um when i was i remember talking to my mom on the phone and i was saying to her this was when i was working in asset management because i was you know i was doing i think also interesting things in that field but i remember telling her mom i'm gonna quit my job and i'm gonna go back and study a master's in quantum physics and she thought i was absolutely insane like she had she had no idea why i would do this and what it even meant and she thought like physicists you know they kind of hide in their rooms alone at night and they don't do anything you know external to the world like it um and now i had a chat with her last week and i said mom do you still feel you know that i did the wrong thing or it was crazy or what what do you think and she just said that she is the first time i think indian parents are very difficult to please or for the first time in my life she said that she's proud of me so this is also a very nice moment for me and my my journey and in in your corporate jobs in finance what was missing was it a purpose or what ingredient was it lacking yeah that's a good question i think i think it was a purpose but i didn't know at the time right so from a just from like um an objective point of view i everything that was happening in my life ticked all the boxes right so i could but then i could like linearly extrapolate the rest of my career path in finance and i could see like okay i was i was on track for this promotion and then in like a couple years i could have this job and and um i realized it wasn't gonna fulfill me it wasn't gonna make me happy but i still didn't know why and i really didn't it only made sense to me once i had found the thing that i was passionate about and so i i always like to say to people um if you're feeling a little bit empty or like you don't have direction or you're still a little bit lost in what you're doing just always keep like furthering yourself keep trying to find something that interests you keep reading keep watching videos and then maybe you have this like aha moment where you realize okay that's that was why i felt a little bit um yeah a little bit lost or whatever that's interesting so you were kind of seeking uncertainty and you've very fittingly chosen quantum physics subject out there and was there like a like a specific moment where you kind of realized okay this is not for me or does it just build up and at some point you were like okay um i think it was building up so um in my job i was i was getting a little bit more and more bored if i can say this and even though the things that i was doing were interesting they were really interesting projects which involved a lot of learning and um but for me i don't know i just kept feeling a little bit distracted and wanting to do something else but i didn't know what but then when i found physics on you know this youtube video i i then like felt this rush of excitement in me and it sent me down this rabbit hole of researching and and watching videos on physics and and you know space time and gravity and all these crazy things and and the more i did this the more i realized that this was um not just a hobby for me anymore it was consuming my thoughts all the time and it wasn't fair to actually stay in finance and do something there when people who are passionate about finance could have this job and and do it do it you know with um with a lot of passion for that so i then you know i realized that yeah i think this was um this is also like fortunate that i realized in time that i could actually leave and then pursue a postgraduate degree in physics and would you say that kind of this journey and having worked for a couple of years gives you a different perspective in comparison to people that go straight you know through undergraduate or masters phd you know no industry experience definitely so i'm so so so grateful for um again my parents and so after i did um my undergraduate degree i actually wanted to specialize and do a master's in something called financial mathematics and they said to me no you need to get out there in the real world and get a job because it it teaches you skills that you are not exposed to in academia and i'm actually so so grateful that i went this way so now um even though i'm like a little bit i guess older than the other phd students i still feel like the mental maturity that i have really really helps me because okay so one it makes me know for sure that this is where i want to be so it makes me really appreciate doing research and and being a student again and two it also gives you confidence in a very different way so like um i'm also so grateful for my time at a company where i spent at stanley because they they gave me a lot of exposure to very senior individuals from a whole bunch of different companies which i met with ceos all the time and like how these conversations with people and then you know as a student coming out into the working world you're often very intimidated and scared with these people who are very senior but eventually this this wears off after you talk to enough people and you know you get comfortable with this and so now i feel like i have this um business acumen and this confidence that really helps so much in um in your interactions as a researcher with people across the world so this this is yeah i'm very grateful for this path it's it definitely contributed a lot to how i approach things so i would say in the last couple of years there has been especially in quantum computing there's this merge of academia and industry and i feel like especially in quantum computing people have um become very active on social media and it's become pretty important um to kind of put yourself out there to make yourself um you know such that people know who you are and what you're doing would you say that like your your business background has has influenced you has like brought this into your mind because like you know usually as a as a physics student you don't think about starting uh you know i don't know having a twitter account you know being active on linkedin you don't think about that you just think about you know solving problems yes absolutely so i think yeah i don't i don't know if i can attribute this directly to my like the different degree or whatever but i always really liked um so i always placed a premium on education and sharing interesting insights from that and so i got linkedin actually yeah i guess through my business degree and it was everybody all my colleagues had it and so i got it and then i found it really really useful for sharing information and educational stuff and also like receiving information and so i always shared stuff that i thought other people would find interesting that i found interesting and this this proved to be really um beneficial because people were very appreciative of this and just like this just in doing that um i i guess i started to find a little bit of a voice right and and every time i had a thought or an interesting article or an interesting paper i would share it and it was always very well received because people like me looking for this information would always reach out and say thank you and so from that perspective because i think generally i actually don't really like social media so much so like i don't have instagram i don't have facebook i don't have these uh these other kind of social media platforms but the educational ones i think are really awesome so twitter i actually just got it last year but i'm loving it so much from an academic point of view because you have all this great access depending on who you follow but like great access to publications resources things that are not only in your field right so there's also like this whole ai and machine learning community and yeah so as a quantum researcher i think also the our community is still very young and um social media is like kind of just part of our lives now and it is important at the end of the day to make yourself known to give yourself um a voice and even though many people don't really like it i think it's important for yourself to create a brand and um and just get recognized and then it makes it so much easier to talk to people about you know academic positions or jobs or these kind of things if people know who you are so from that perspective it's crucial yeah i totally agree i think especially in quantum computing everybody should take the opportunity of having a twitter account because you can really you can really tune in to the thoughts in real time from the leading experts in the field and i think there's just such a massive networking effect um that people are only now kind of understanding i think uh in like in the top universities it's now kind of becoming normal that you should have a twitter account that people kind of also post their research there so it's really interesting to see that because when i did my my masters a couple years back um and it was just starting out like uh when i was in zurich they were kind of saying okay guys you should you should start a twitter account and the professors are like why why should we do that but now it makes more sense yeah and i really like your youtube from south africa oh thank you very much um amira you're from south africa right uh what does south africa mean because i would i would think you know you could have done your phd like anywhere you know but you've chosen to be in south africa so is there a special meaning yes this is a this is a very um a very nice question because it was also something i thought a lot about before choosing to stay so when you when you grow up in south africa um it's weird it's weird the mentality you have um growing up in a developing country because you always think that to be successful you need to leave and you need to go overseas somewhere you know and and get like access to the best quality researchers and educators in the world but then when i when i did my master's okay so i couldn't go overseas for my master's easily because i had no physics background and all this and i was really really fortunate to find francesco's group the quantum research group at the university of quezon united and it felt very serendipitous because it was in my hometown my home city the city i grew up in and going there made me realize that actually we have skills and resources here in south africa locally and there's no real reason to to go overseas and i think i really owe this a lot to my supervisor so to francesco and also maria schult because they gave me access to education that i would have received at mit stanford you know you name your top university they are such brilliant researchers and the knowledge that they passed down to us as students was invaluable and so after having this exposure my masters with these people these high quality researchers it made the decision of staying so much easier and and south africa and specifically is a very special place because um having traveled a little bit in my master's i realized that the rest of the world is actually not so different in terms of like its efficiency but south africa is a special place in that there's so many different people and the culture is very unique and um home will always be home i think that's that's something to say but um yeah i just it's a very interesting place and i like it here quite a lot and i think there's a lot of potential to do a lot of interesting things here you have uh an inside look into what is happening in south africa and in in africa in general um i'm seeing quite a bit of activity coming up at the moment can you give us an idea of like um what's there to come what is the research landscape like yes i think you mentioned it earlier steve like there's now this blurred lines between research between like academia and industry so in africa specifically we're seeing so much excitement from industry players around quantum computing in particular so there's now like all these really nice exciting partnerships between companies and and universities so for example there's something called the arua network and this was really pioneered by ibm and they have a network of universities all around africa that gives researchers free access to um some of their hardware devices some of the quantum computers available by the cloud so people can use them and do like interesting research tasks for their projects and um and we're seeing more and more things like this so that also the ai community is really interested in quantum computing and the ai community in africa is very very strong um in particular there's something called the deep learning in daba and they're also like quite curious on what quantum machine learning looks like and so we're seeing all these um all this excitement coming around and and a lot of people are now we're now trying to form these these communities locally so we have these weekly one quantum africa meetings where people who are just interested in quantum computing based in africa can come together and talk about ideas and this is really important right because um researchers for example in zurich are are sitting and designing quantum algorithms but they're not going to think about the problems that are inherent in africa that and not because they don't care but just because this is not this is not what they're exposed to it's not their inherent bias so people like us actually have to um think ahead of the curve right we have to think about the problems that are unique to africa and start addressing them with quantum algorithms now because if we don't do it now then we could be 30 20 years behind when when things come around and we have to apply them and then start from scratch so i'm really grateful for all these like communities that are coming around and also now we're starting to see like interest from also banks and investment companies and so we're starting to see a lot of telecommunications companies are approaching and trying to understand quantum computing so i think we are really moving quite nicely in in that's in that space and i'm very excited to see how it how it all turns out in the next couple years so is this currently more of an academic focus or is there also interest from industry or startups coming up so startups i i think that this is a space that um that we're lacking a little bit right so i think there's a lot of potential for people who want to create businesses and quantum computing in africa to do this um but in terms of interest from industry i i'm actually blown away with how much interest there is so i um there's also even a national government initiative in place that is around centered around this idea of the fourth industrial revolution and in that quantum computing is quite is growing to be a little bit of a focus there so that's quite exciting and the industry players that are are interested are from very large and and also different um different how to say different fields or different um sectors so we're seeing a lot of most of the interest i think from finance but also like telecommunications also logistics industries logistics companies and they are interested in like specifically like these proof of concept ideas so how can we actually tangibly show quantum computing is useful and that they should look at it and so these are the things i think the researchers need to investigate so that's why industry players are approaching universities and trying to understand really like fundamentally is there something we can do here so this is this is what we're exploring that sounds very exciting from the way to describe it it seems like there's even more going on than in europe because i think in europe the industry part is quite lacking at the moment sure yeah all right so let's let's get into uh quantum computing i would like to to start off with the community because i think the community in quantum computing is really unique because people don't really have um a certain path to get into quantum computing some people have studied math some people have studied finance like you some people have studied physics or engineering and so i think it attracts quite unique people and it also creates a very unique community can you talk about that yeah so i am again i feel so lucky to be a part of um of this of this community right so you're totally right i think what makes it unique is that is that the skills that are required for quantum computing are skills that one can i think quite generally acquire so as long as you have you know a little bit of um i think the barriers to entry like are quite low in that sense and as long as you have persistence then you can you can teach yourself what is required for the basics of quantum computing and the community is is a very unique one because i think you know also the the whole field of quantum computing is still quite new and quite young and so the people that are coming together are also i think you know these mostly young people and guided by i guess professors and and industry players and really there's a lot of diversity i see in the community so there is um i don't know just it's it's very interesting to see the dynamics here because i very much feel like for example if you just contrast it with a typical physics physics kind of community um i think physics people kind of place a very high premium on on knowing everything on like knowledge and having a strong mathematical background and strong physics background and this is this is what's what's important whereas in quantum computing the community is very much um focused on helping each other and it's totally okay if you don't know everything right and this is this is amazing for me because even in finance there's a huge premium on on having to know everything right you should be the smartest person in the room and if you're not then you know you have to work to be but in in the quantum setting everybody is there to kind of help each other guide each other because everybody is still figuring out what to do right i mean we don't even really know what um what all the advantages of quantum computing are it's still very open and and so there's a lot more togetherness there's a lot more and even you see this um you know chats between competitors like um you know competing companies competing universities everybody just there's there's um there's no um competitiveness let's say like it's it's i guess there are but it's not as severe or intense and it's really nice to be a part of this community because you feel very welcomed and i'll give you a nice example is like this this kisket camp that happened in europe last year in in zurich actually i by chance managed to get an invite right through um stefan vonna who's now now my boss at ibm and i was terrified to go there at first i i knew nobody at all um and i was flying all the way from south africa to my first time to switzerland and i was really really nervous and i like stalked some people online and i saw oh my god they're from caltech and they're from eth and they're from all these crazy universities with you know specialization and nanophotonics and all this stuff and then when i got there this was totally not the environment i was expecting everybody was so so cool and um helpful and collaborative and even the different competing teams were helping each other and it was just it shifted my mindset into realizing that it's okay not to know everything because we're all kind of just trying to figure it out and so this is really what i loved about the quantum community and you you will find somebody like you in it and you'll get along and i really enjoyed this aspect yeah it's like a massive startup essentially everybody's kind of yeah trying to figure out uh on the go there's no no corporate structure yet i'd say or very little yeah exactly and even in the big players which is which is really unique i think definitely definitely so let's let's talk about your field of research quantum machine learning this kind of unites two hype terms quantum computing machine learning and it comes together in this in this beautiful thing can you explain in in simple terms what is quantum machine learning and what are kind of the promises of this field of research yeah sure so you're totally right in that uh yeah it marries two very hyped terms and i'm always when i explain this i always feel bad to kind of let people down in that one we i don't think we know very concretely what the advantages will be right so to explain quantum machine learning in a in a very high level i think one needs to explain machine learning at first right and if you understand machine learning then i think it's very easy to understand quantum machine learning so um in machine learning i mean what you're trying to do is you're trying to program a computer to understand data or information right is to somehow see like patterns or trends or correlations in data and and information such that it it's meaningful for you so maybe it can guide you to do some sort of task and the whole point of of why it's called machine learning is because this this rule that is applied or this um this this programming that you want to do in the computer is its dynamic so in that it can update itself it can modify itself as new information comes in and this is like you know the idea of of doing machine learning but now quantum machine learning is really quite straightforward in that you're taking exactly the same idea but you're trying to integrate it with a different device a different computer different physical device quantum quantum computer and so the research is not only trying to understand if we can make machine learning rules and functions run on quantum computers but also just to see if there are any advantages or any differences we can get by running on these different physical devices these quantum computers and um and i think in terms of the advantages we're not it's not so obvious so everybody is a lot of people are focused on speed ups like can we speed things that we we know we can do on a normal computer can we speed it up by using a quantum computer but there are also other more interesting questions to ask right like can we create entirely new rules using quantum principles using quantum computers and maybe this is useful in a machine learning task maybe this can guide us in in our thinking in a little bit different um differently and so the advantage is because i think the field is is still relatively quite new it's um very problem specific at the moment and also very dependent on the hardware so at the moment the quantum computers that we have access to are still very limited in what they can actually do so um it's gonna be a very exciting space to watch i think and um yeah and it's also very nice place to be a researcher because there's just so much that we don't know and um and that we can find out hopefully there there has been this um this road map from ibm this um you know in this in this conference in the q2b conference um they presented this roadmap where they're planning to have over a thousand cubits by 2023 and in the talk they kind of said that a thousand cubits is is really a very special point where we might start to to run error correction codes and try that out is is this you think uh also something special for quantum machine learning do you think you know this this number a thousand qubits is something where we might start running some some interesting um algorithms so with quantum machine learning specifically i actually think we can do it sooner so the reason i say this actually i think the number where we where we might see some interesting advantages with quantum machine learning is actually more around where we can't simulate things so much so well anymore so maybe like around 50 60 cubits i think this this is probably actually the the reasonable amount and the reason i say this is because a lot of quantum machine learning algorithms don't really require quantum i don't really require error correction because they run on something called these variational principles right so there are different circuits like quantum circuits where you can you can have have them depend on parameters so they are called like parameterized circuits and because of these parameters you can train these circuits you can update these parameters and they're very robust to noise so they can kind of like absorb some of the noise that you see in your quantum systems in your quantum devices and these these uh parametrized circuits really play a huge role in quantum machine learning they come up in in most of the models that we design and so from that perspective i actually think that in quantum machine learning if we have like 50 60 qubits we can already start to do some interesting things using these variational models these variational circuits um so yeah i mean don't don't quote me on that but well i guess you are gonna quote me on that but uh i'm hopeful i'm hopeful that uh we can do it sooner yeah okay that there's also this notion um that like in classical machine learning um people use noise deliberately randomness and in quantum in the quantum computers that we have today this is built in this is a feature right yep yeah exactly yeah i'm so using noise to do computation is super interesting but i i honestly don't know a lot about it right so there's there's also a lot of interesting work being done on like perturbation so um these adversarial attacks so if somebody is trying to actually like um infiltrate your your communication or your quantum machine learning algorithm then like how much perturbation or noise do they have to inject to to kind of flip your label of your data for example or just like corrupt your algorithm and so this is also like really interesting and the idea of using noise to do computation is super fascinating but yeah i think it's i think it's not trivial i think it's something quite complicated to understand right because the noise in quantum models is also a tricky thing to get to get right to understand so something that's always a bit difficult for me to understand is in in quantum machine learning you're taking classical data then you're bringing it into the hilbert space onto the quantum computer and then you're doing something in this quantum space in the hilbert space and then you bring it back into into the classical world right and so i'm trying to understand kind of what is the what is the intuition behind the advantages that you might get right so i think um so let's take a step back right so so um quantum machine learning is is one of many things and i think one one one kind of subset that you describe now is really when we take classical data and uh put it onto a quantum computer but you know we can also have like quantum data and or process that with a classical computer so really quantum machine learning is quite a broad term but i think the most popular example or subset is the one you just described and um i must be honest i don't think the advantages are very clear right so we have these vague notions of like why we would do this and the reason is because i think largely because of two things so one this like exponential hillbid space that we have access to and two maybe these different um these different computational things can give us access to interesting um interesting results so like what i mean by that like maybe like quantum superposition or entanglement maybe somehow can create some different relationships or correlations in our data such that it's meaningful but i think you know these are very broad broad ideas um and so i think really trying to figure out these little components in these quantum machine learning settings are very important and they're still open questions so the first step like you mentioned is really to take your data figure out how to even map it to a quantum state like how is that how is that even efficient or how is that done in such a useful way so maybe for example one might figure out how to take data and map it into this hilbert space such that you separate classes right so if you've got pictures of cats and dogs maybe you map all the cats into one space one side of the hillbid space and the dogs into another so that when you apply some other operations after that it's really easy to understand what's a cap and what's a dog um and so maybe this quantum hillbid space offers us something different something interesting and then the next step after you figure out how to map your data into hilbert space is really like what model do you apply what parameterized circuit do you apply right so so the idea then also kind of relates to this idea of support vector machines in classical machine learning where you often want to transform your data such that you can easily classify it for example so maybe mapping your data into hilbert space um is done in such a way that you transform it to be easily separable so the model that you apply after that the the classifier or the parameterized circuit whatever you want to call it maybe it can figure out how to separate data very easily and the last part is super non-trivial as well like this measurement right so understanding um how how to post process the classical information that you get out this is also sort of quite subjective and i think it's also like a very open question on how to do this so um there are a lot of like suggestions on how to to take your your measurements and and transform them into labels or classical outputs that are are meaningful and but i think it's still not so clear as to why like given a certain data set what should you do and this is what makes it interesting to research these questions and i think the crucial thing um is this feature map right where you map the classical data um into the hilbert space um can you talk about kind of um you know there's been this quantum supremacy paper by uh google last year and this is essentially just a circuit that is very complicated that cannot be uh simulated classically and i think this idea is also used in in quantum machine learning right right so i think so so the google paper i think what they do there is is is very interesting but also like very um very specific so so what they what they are able to show is that you can from a from a certain quantum circuit get a probability distribution from it that is very difficult to get classically what that means in a machine learning setting i'm not so sure that specific um circuit or model right but probability distributions are really interesting for machine learning all the time because you want to often like get maybe um a probability distribution over your your labels for your data or you want some insight generated by a probability distribution and um and so there are this feature map this idea of encoding your your data into a quantum state in a meaningful way is um turns out to be super super important for what what you have access to after that right so so there was a very beautiful paper that came out recently on um understanding how um how these feature maps work so so how what functions does your your quantum circuit give rise to how many what functions can it express if you have a certain feature map a certain data encoding strategy and so what they were actually able to show in that paper was that quantum circuits can actually be described as partial fourier series in your data so your data determines um some like some parameters in this fourier series then and this is really amazing right because then you can use all this rich fourier analysis to understand the types of functions that your quantum model can express given your data and your feature map so this was a really interesting result and really nice tool that we can now use as researchers to understand quantum models and the feature map you're absolutely right i think it's the most important ingredient in this quantum machine learning setting and you usually want to make sure that it's that the feature map is not you cannot simulate it classically easily right i think i think this is important yes because um you know then we can show quantum advantage right we can finally say like look this is something you cannot do on a classical computer and it's useful therefore quantum computing is important but i think i was also thinking a little bit about this the other day because like if you have what does it mean to have a feature map that's classically simulatable it means that you need you have a straightforward encoding method that's quite stupid but but also eventually when you have enough qubits in your system even the stupid encoding method becomes unsimulatable right i mean you can't um after a certain number of qubits you cannot efficiently simulate anything in quantum in the in the circuit right and so um this is a good question so i think for near-term applications yes we really want to make this argument that um our feature map is useful and and classically intractable belongs to us a class of models where we can never simulate it on a classical computer that is definitely the first goal the first prize but maybe these stupid encoding strategies are still beneficial in the long run i don't know yeah let's let's talk about uh your recent publication with alessio figally a fields medalist a proper mathematician this is the highest price you can achieve it's even better than the nobel prize how how did that happen yeah i i 100 owe this this relationship to my colleagues at ibm's in zurich um so i mentioned the other authors of this also david christian stefan from this from the zurich group right at ibm and alessio got invited to to give a talk at something called this ibm distinguished speaker series so so ibm really organizes um all these like very well-known people to come and give talks every now and then so for example i think the last one was joshua benjio and um and back when it was in person which i think was like sometime last year then um my colleagues actually got to meet alessio in person and they said and in this presentation alessia i was working with some other researchers on something called the effective dimension of a machine learning model and so the effective dimension really tries to understand how how expressive is a certain model a certain class of models so how how many different functions can it represent how powerful is it and my boss stefan found this idea very very interesting and thought oh well let's let's let's think about it in a quantum setting and so he spoke to alessio and alessia was really keen really excited and again just my luck i happened to be starting an internship with the zurich team and i was you know into quantum machine learning so stefan mentioned this project to me and i said yeah sounds sounds really really fascinating really interesting um who will i be working with and uh and then when they mentioned who alessio was i mean honestly i i didn't i didn't know right and then i googled and i saw all his accomplishments and i was like i was just like wow this is crazy that i get this opportunity to work with with someone so distinguished someone so amazing and when i met with him um unfortunately like so i was in zurich at the time but eta just closed so we couldn't actually meet in person but every interaction i had with him online virtually he is the most humble person that you'll ever meet so he explains things on on such a beautiful uh in such a beautiful way in a very like geometric way like he describes things in terms of like mathematical objects but in a way that even like a a grade grade one like a six-year-old can understand you know so this is really helpful for me and um working with him was a beautiful experience i learned a lot i it was you can clearly feel that you're in the presence of someone quite special right and so this was really a very very wonderful experience and i think the paper also turned out to be something that i'm very proud of and um my colleagues and i worked very hard on this result and there are a lot of follow-up pieces that we that we will look at now going forward on this and so i'm very happy with with what happened here yeah i'm still trying to wrap my head around the paper but i think it has a lot of implications other as of our other variations of machine learning maybe for optimization maybe for quantum chemistry just this variational circuit idea in general can you maybe uh give a high level overview of can you maybe give a high level overview of what the paper is about yes sure so um so it really started off with this question of um of of can we find an advantage with with quantum models right with certain with certain quantum machine learning models in particular and like i said then alessio did some work on introducing this this idea called the affected dimension and the effective dimension really tries to understand how um how how large is your model in a very high dimensional space and the larger your model is in this high dimensional space then it should be able to capture more relationships between your data or your variables it should be more powerful it should be more expressive so the effective dimension really tries to understand this for any statistical model so what we do in the paper is we we take this effective dimension and we simply calculate it for a bunch of different models so we we look at something that really makes up the fundamental building blocks of deep learning models on normal computers these are called feed forward neural networks right so we look at the effective dimension of feed forward neural networks and then we also compare the effect compare that to the effective dimension of certain quantum models so we call them quantum neural networks but they're exactly like this idea that we just spoke about where you have circuits that depend on some parameters and what we found was that certain quantum models have a much higher effective dimension than the classical models and this then should mean that these these quantum models are are bigger are um are more powerful more expressive but why right so we didn't understand really why so we tried to dig in to the details and and see what what is actually going on what makes them special and what we found was that um so with with machine learning models you have something called a loss function associated with it and the loss function really tries to um capture how good is your model at doing something relative to nation and these loss functions have their own um landscapes themselves right so generally you want to minimize these loss functions you want to find like the global minima of the function but these functions in high dimensional spaces are really difficult to understand so the effective dimension we actually linked it to understanding these lost landscapes and what we saw was that these that certain quantum models have a very favorable loss landscape meaning that you can optimize them quite nicely and so then we also trained our models on data sets we actually looked at their performance how will they classify information and it turns out that these quantum models also do well on that front as well and step is really to understand why the lost landscapes look this way and this is the next part of the research so really what we found in the paper was one we found a class of quantum models that have a higher effective dimension they're more expressive and two they also have a very nice optimization landscape so we can we can optimize them efficiently or better than classical models hopefully and so this was this was the result and um we also show of course that the effective dimension is uh is useful is meaningful is interesting so we take alessio's um stuff and we kind of build on it and we show classically why this is an interesting measure and then we use it and this is this is really all we do in the paper and you also run experiments on real devices right yes and i think that was really nice and important to show that we can actually train i mean it was a very small model and um so we used like the iris a subset of the iris data set and only like eight trainable parameters but what is nice is that the model trains very nicely it trains very well and even though there's a lot of noise in these devices um we were still able to execute the experiment and it gave us very nice results yeah i think it's a beautiful paper and uh a lot of math that i still have to understand but that's a given if you're working with a fields medalist um amira you this work uh where this work happened um at ibm research zurich and in in zurich in cooperation with people in zurich um i lived in zurich for for two years during my master's and i think zurich and switzerland in general is a very unique and special place um can you maybe talk about like what was it like first coming to zurich from from south africa like what was your impression yeah oh wow yeah so it was um it was a massive culture shock for me right so i i mean i i already know like zurich is a firstly from like a a safety perspective it's really different right because there's like no crime there is nothing wrong in zurich everything you you need is is easily findable and um and so like from this perspective and the efficiency of the of the city and the and the country it was it was a totally different experience for me because um so for example i was doing i got there right and i i got lost and on the way back home walking back home and i remember like being in the woods somewhere and and i was freaking out i was so so scared because i thought like somebody is going to murder me okay or like rob all right and the next day i was telling my my colleagues i was telling my colleagues about it and they all started laughing at me they were like nothing bad ever happens here like you don't have to feel this way but this is this is how i feel right because in south africa we can't walk around easily like this is unfortunately the case that it's not um it's not the safest place in the world right so these are like these weird and um zurich is it almost felt too perfect it was like a kind of like a simulation of a video game where like everything is in order and structured and um i must admit like sometimes i i felt a little bit um out of place but then luckily i had these wonderful friends that i made very quickly right in in the team at ibm and they made it very easy to to adapt to to a new lives i wasn't there admittedly i wasn't there for very long right because of unfortunately because of covert so i had to um come home but the time that i was there was made very enjoyable thanks to my colleagues and my friends and like we went skiing for the first time in my life i saw snow and i was i was skiing in austria for example and it was just a very wonderful experience and i really i'm looking forward to going back eventually when when things clear up and and experience the city a little bit more and maybe hopefully yeah find more interesting things out because it's absolutely beautiful as well the mountains and the scenery and everything is this is wonderful what's really interesting and fascinating for me about switzerland is that you have this stark contrast we have like a a farm in some mountain village and right next to it you have like some research building from some global company which costs like hundreds of millions of of swiss francs and you have like the smartest people in the world working there and nexus is just a farmer like you know doing his thing i think that's really unique about the country yeah yeah it is a very special place and also like everybody the quality of life is just significantly higher everybody is is i think also like generally quite happy and uh and rich i mean that's also something very different from what i've experienced and yeah it's definitely i would say a very nice place to go and stay and visit and um and check out so yeah i'm glad i got to do that before things got really bad with travel and stuff all right amira let's let's i think we we touched on a lot of different things i think let's wrap up with a couple of last questions um so for a high school student watching or an undergraduate watching that is really fascinated about quantum machine learning or quantum computing and they really want to get into it where do they start how do you get into this field yes so i love this question and i think um some things are very important to have and to try and keep and one is that like your curiosity right so always keep your mind open and open to learning and asking questions even if they're crazy even if people tell you that um they don't make sense or whatever the case is so always keep this this curiosity right so so if you're a high school leader or an undergraduate person and you're excited about quantum computing keep that excitement and and read more educate yourself so be persistent in learning because we live in such an amazing time where you know we have access to all these free resources online so use them i strongly suggest um and especially if you're you know you're young you can absorb information quickly and and do that do teach yourself as much as possible so like there are wonderful thankfully there are wonderful communities and resources where you can you can easily google and understand what quantum computing is so like i just named a few like the quantum open source foundation they have a github page where you have access to all the um nice resources to get started with quantum computing so i would strongly suggest reading some of these and then i think what will become clear to you is one if you immediately like it or not because this is also something that i mean it's it's very easy to get excited about quantum computing because you you think it's this fascinating black box that you know you need to go and find out more about it so in doing that you will know if you like it or not and then also you will get an idea of what you like about it and when you start to know these questions start to put these pieces together it will make the next step in your career path very clear right so it will then answer like what do i need to study okay i find the physics part of the of the quantum of quantum computing really exciting then okay for you your your degree then you specialize in physics right or no i find the software part really exciting so focus on like computer science some sort of stuff like this so i think figuring out the pieces for you for your own personal desires is really important and i'd say the best way to do that is to just like remain curious and open to learning and push yourself be persistent be um be ambitious because it doesn't matter how old you are um and the barriers to entry in quantum computing right now like i said is still quite low so you can really i mean i know so many um 17 16 year olds that are passionate about quantum computing and actually making a difference and contributing to software packages and doing amazing things so this is definitely something doable if you are passionate if you are interested and then the next part also i think is really important is find a mentor reach out to people and and do it in a respectful way right so read first about quantum computing educate yourself as much as you can and then reach out to mentors and say this is what i've read this is what i've done are you interested in having a chat and this is also something really important because having a mentor even for for me is something crucial so yeah this is the advice i would give and i think there are also a lot of great resources from ibm i think ibm has really built a a great community and provides a lot of value and resources right absolutely so the the kisskip community so qis kit um i'm always just blown away by what these individuals do and they're also you know people from all kinds of backgrounds some don't even um some are not technical at all so they're more just like focused on so on community initiatives and they are looking at rolling out courses to high school students to um to university grad students and you know all levels even people i mean we ran a summer school a couple weeks ago maybe a couple months ago now but we did this globally online and catered for over 5 000 people and so um these opportunities thanks to companies like ibm and communities like the kiskit one they are coming up more and more and it's becoming more accessible to get into quantum computing so definitely keep an eye out for that there are mailing lists that you can sign up to and just explore i think there's so much out there and if you don't know about it just one google search and it'll send you down the rabbit hole and just continue with this um what uh what can you tell me about like different career paths in quantum computing because at the moment quantum computing is very uh research focused it's mainly research roles it usually requires a phd or at least a master's degree there are also a couple of let's say more business orientated roles can you kind of sketch the landscape and maybe how you think this will change in the future yeah it's quite an interesting one so um so the this of course is is definitely there but i think this is also changing in that there isn't we realize there's a need for every other function right so for example um if you like working with people and um so human resources for example like focusing on understanding who's a good uh candidate to be in quantum computing so there's now a special focus on people trying to hire for quantum computing roles right so human resources is one of them um there are of course business roles as you mentioned so they're really nice they're really nice like uh two sides of the coin where if you have a little bit of the technical expertise but you also really like communicating and interacting with businesses then this is also an option that you can be a sort of business development person in quantum computing so this is also really quite cool um and then also like of course there are admin roles there are um other areas like more the cto kind of areas and the ceo kind of areas you want to do a startup there's just like really i think so many things that one can do but one that i was really impressed with at ibm was this community's perspective right so um there are events that we we host as ibm is often and the community team consists of all crazy kind of people where they have backgrounds in like marketing or um even like a media you know these these people and but then they just fell in love with quantum and not necessarily like the technical research part of things but just helping people have access to education to tools to to devices to events and so they also like started creating their own roles within ibm and then making it happen right so we then if they work out then then they haven't and they get created and so like we've got like quantum content developers quantum gamer game developers like all these things that you that never existed a couple years ago people are finding their niche and creating roles for themselves so it's still like in the future i think the landscape is is not so clear because people are still figuring it out but what's awesome is that all this freedom that you have to do this right so you've you figure out what your talents are and what you like and then that you can probably create a space for yourself in which you become like i don't know the first quantum musician or whatever this means or you can you can do this it's it's quite cool it's quite interesting and would you say that this is uh true globally or is it more like you know obviously in in you know ibm research zurich there's more quantum computing um going on that in other places it's very concentrated there right that's true so um i think what's what's nice is that um communities are emerging from all different places right so um i think our so just a function of ibm for example like the the main community team is based in yorktown but they actually now are doing a strong drive to to hire more people across africa for example and and and in europe they also now have people sitting there that are solely focused on quantum community initiatives and so i think this is going to shift where we're going to start to see like this this more uniform distribution over the continent and also there are these programs like um the kisket advocate programs right so i see the kids get backpack on behind you over there and you'll know all about this program steve so and we have we aim to have people in every country uh representing like a community initiative or a driver or running something and and this already we have i can't even remember the number but over 100 countries i think we have a representation in so this is really i think quite awesome and um yeah i don't know let's see how how things develop but i think we'll only see more and more diversification across geographies and understanding quantum and community events yeah this this has also been an observation of mine um that in in classical computing and in tech it is extremely centered around silicon valley and the us in general but with quantum computing um there's obviously a lot of stuff happening in the us but there are also other hubs around the world where stuff is popping up and so it's it really i think you don't necessarily as you're showing yourself you don't necessarily have to move to silicon valley to be in quantum computing it's happening in various different places exactly yeah yeah it's so nice so finally uh one last question if you had to nail um it down to one quality what do you think is the most important to be successful in this field in quantum computing ah okay so um i must admit this is gonna sound cliche but i think it's i think it's the most important thing that one can develop and that is persistence right so really hard work come it comes down to that at the end of the day right so i think this is a quality that's necessary for any scientist regardless of what field you're in and i actually attended a very nice talk by my supervisor the other day maria schultz again and she also highlighted this this this point where you know like everybody thinks that to be a scientist you need to be really crazy smart right you need to be very intelligent but actually no the other qualities are are so much more important and specifically that quality of hard work and persistence the ability to keep going at a problem to understand every facet of it even if it doesn't make sense you know like at first to keep reading that textbook over and over again until the language finally makes sense to you that to me is the most important thing and and i'm living proof of it because when i started my masters i was working in industry for a couple years and i had forgotten all the fundamentals of the mathematics i needed um but my motivation was there i knew that i could relearn it i could teach myself i could start to understand what a matrix was again and uh you know how to multiply this i had to go and read these basics again from the start and and my my one of my professors dropped you know nielsen and truang's textbook in in my lab so for those who don't know this is like the bible or quantum computing right and i opened this thing and it looked like a different language to me oh you have nice very good but i remember i remember thinking there's no way i'm gonna understand this in time to complete a masters and so but instead of freaking out and developing a mental block i um i read it and i read it and i read it and and i and every word that i didn't understand i would google it and i would look at look at it in wikipedia and then i wouldn't understand what what was there in the wikipedia article so then i would have to click on another link that would take me to another wikipedia article and understand that word and you know cascade until you eventually understand the bottom and then like work yours you'll work your way back up and this is not hard right you have to have the persist i mean this is not easy you have to have the persistence the motivation and so my i strongly believe that like having this and being sure that you know this is this is the thing you want to do you you can do it and you just need to push on you need to push forward and you need to keep working even though on a day-to-day basis it might not seem like you're getting anywhere but then when you look back after a couple months and you realize actually you're starting to make some some dents in this in this you know in this problem in this world and yeah it's very rewarding and so this is the one quality it's like hard work persistence as a researcher and there are some days where you just feel like why the hell are you even doing this but there are some days where you realize oh man i'm just so happy that i'm that i did it because it all makes sense now that's really worth it yeah that's a great message i think we should end uh the conversation on that note amira thank you so much for taking the time it was a pleasure thank you so much for having me steve it was really fun talking to you as always
