hello everyone my name is frank and i lead the energy environment series for the mit of northern california i'm delighted to kick off our 2021 season of all virtual events featuring top speakers in the field beginning this season with none other than tom steyer i'll be back at the end of the program to announce our october and november speakers but now i would like to introduce mark blachon our moderator for today's event who will introduce tom and conduct this fireside chat take it away mark you doug hello everyone welcome to a very special mit energy environment alumni club event i am mark plachon i'll be your moderator this afternoon in a fireside chat with tom steyer questions were collected in advance during the registration additional questions can be submitted via the q a button at the bottom of your screen we'll try to get to as many as we can um i've started up the virtual fireplace here for our fire fireside chat tom so let's get started okay i have a fire you almost have a fireplace in the background um hey we we live in interesting and challenging times nature's threats forest wildfires right now hurricanes floods droughts ice sheet laws species extinctions they're all around us and they're being accelerated by human activity the international panel on climate change the ipcc and national climate assessment reports recommend urgent international action has to be done to transform our energy ecosystem meanwhile the u.s unfortunately on the verge of withdrawing from the paris accord with upcoming elections and the appointment of a new supreme court justice climate change energy and environmental policy are important points of differentiation right now between the parties in fact the gop has no climate platform so there's really only one platform to consider so we're thrilled to have you tom here to talk about climate energy action and policy as a former presidential candidate you've become a climate change activist philanthropist thank you so much for being here to help us with this um tom is now the co-chair of the biden for president campaign's climate engagement advisory council if i got that right it's a mouthful perfect person to explain to us how joe biden's buildback better plan will address all these issues that we're putting on the table we're putting in the fire but tom let's get started um you are a successful businessman and something happened along the way that caused you to say i'm gonna have a second career i'm gonna do something really different and that's when you changed to becoming this politically active philanthropist and the climate activist can you talk us through that and by the way we invited you know this is the mit club we invited the stanford club and the berkeley club a lot of other people who are into this so you can assume this is a crowd that enjoy let's say believes in science so you can go you can go from that so mark first of all thank you for having me i know mit's commitment not just to science and engineering but to focusing on energy and climate has been really extraordinary and unique and i've been on the interactive program that mit has to try out different policies and i'm scheduled to go on it again because it's a really fun game to play but also an important game to play but but literally i've known about what mit has been doing for about 15 years let me also say that my son sam was a grad student at stamford in um kind of cs but he also was the president of the energy club on stanford's campus which is he said is the fanciest name for any job which really involves going out and buying pizza for everybody else in the history but let me say that he did that because he also sam is also very committed to the move to clean energy to all the issues you were talking about in terms of climate extinction you know really the degradation the severe degradation of the natural world at the expense of human beings and every other species on the planet and so how did i get there look i was an investor i'm from the united states if you can't tell from my accent i basically grew up believing that our system involved a lot of screaming and yelling but a lot of on the surface but underneath it a lot of compromise and effectiveness and i felt that you know my job was to allocate capital in ways that would make our country more productive and you know successful and that the political system would work in its own way and then sitting around the table about 15 years ago with our four kids i asked him you know what do you guys think and we came to the conclusion wow the system's not working on climate so was there a trigger event it was that literally that was it is like we used to play this game of if you look 100 years in the future and look back on our time what are they going to say about we're so stupid like how could these people have been so stupid and we were like because you know you can do that with a lot of times in history you look back and think wow they missed the big point and so we decided there are a lot of things we could talk about but the one that they're going to be talking about in 100 years is how could they like destroy the planet like what were they thinking so i thought at the time okay i get that it's tech you know i was on the stanford board at the time and i thought okay stanford mit you know all these fancy research universities can solve the tech problem that's the problem we need to make the transition faster it's got to work economically so i spent i spent invested in research at universities and then i thought no i actually think that's going to work it's on a good trajectory it must be that people don't know it's going to work that you know people think it's going to destroy jobs so i did a series of projects called the risky business projects showing that actually it creates jobs it creates higher wages it creates faster growth it avoids huge health problems like in any sort of measurable way this is good for americans as a whole and good for the world so and so then i thought how is it possible that we're here and i and i started about a little over a decade ago to realize oh no this is politics there are reasons why this is happening it's deliberate it's not that we don't have the tech it's not that we don't understand it they're people who want this and that's when i became involved politically and and so to me recognizing the problem was literally sitting around our kitchen table coming up with what i thought the underlying reason why this most advanced society in history was unable to deal with a fundamental problem about health safety and existence was a different question and it's it's been over a decade of learning exactly how a very very complex arcane human entrenched political system works and trying to figure out how to move us forward as a society and a country in a political system to a place where we feel like we have to deal with this and we can deal with this and we have to do it right now so yeah that led you to become a presidential candidate and we all loved that you were running and here we are but you you made a great run but now that you gave it up how did you and why did you make the transition to join the biden plan and actually what was your role in creating the biden climate plan well let me say this i have said i've been asked by reporters for over a decade why are you doing this like why are you running the no on 23 campaign in california to prevent oil companies from rolling back progressive energy laws why are you doing all these things that i've been doing for 10 or 15 years and i always said and they always thought that i was being like clever i said i'm just trying to do the thing that has the most positive impact sorry and uh so i ran for president because i felt like somebody's got to take this to the american people somebody's got to make this case it wasn't the only thing i was saying i was talking a lot about racial justice there were a lot of things i was talking about that i thought other people didn't want to bring up because it didn't they didn't think it was smart but that i thought was important and i i thought there was i honestly was running because i thought i could be the candidate and when i realized i couldn't be the candidate after south carolina i stopped running and i'd had a series of conversations believe it or not but backstage during the debates okay vice president biden and he it was actually very reassuring because it was like wow this guy knows a lot about climate and he seems to care quite a bit about climate and i don't think that was something that if you looked at his platform then or if you listen to him on stage you wouldn't have said wow this guy's really pretty well versed in this and cares because it just wasn't a focus so as soon as i stopped running i probably stopped literally on saturday night i went and walked across the bridge in selma with a bunch of other people to reenact bloody sunday on sunday i came home on sunday night to northern california and i probably talked to vice president biden on tuesday about climb and then so you know he became the you know de facto nominee and then the nominee i did a series along with other people i basically said we can't have a climate community that has been the way it has in the past been you know sort of separate divided by our policy differences instead of united by our policy agreements that we had to work together and be effective whether that was environmental justice advocates whether it was um traditional environmentalists whether it was young people specifically focused on climate we had to be a unit pushing on policy pushing on fundraising pushing on get out the vote pushing on the conversation the public conversation so i've been trying to be involved in all those things you know we've done a series of climate leaders for biden fundraisers that have raised over 15 or 16 million bucks yeah fantastic you know we and in every one of them it was just on climate and we talked through his plan what we were worried about and he did a great job just did a great job both in terms of priority passion knowledge concern so can we can we get you to to take a detour and kind of present the highlights of the plan well you know so let me ask you to draw distinction we've got the green new deal kind of as an initiative we've got world war zero as an initiative how do we think about this platform gluing them all together okay so i think the way to think about the biden plan is this the build it's part of the build back better plan and so to vice president biden's credit his infrastructure green infrastructure plan also addresses the huge unemployment issue in the united states of america today so what he's trying to do in terms of changing to a green infrastructure to enable private enterprise to push through clean energy in an even bigger way is also an attempt to put people to work in good paying middle class union jobs and it specifically deals with the issues around environmental justice so that it specifically deals with cleaning up the air water and toxins in underserved black and brown communities which i'm sure the people on this call so i'm not trying to assume that everyone doesn't know this but my experience politically is if you want to come up with a good environmental policy if you want to come up with a good climate policy you need to start with environmental justice you need to start with leadership from communities where the kids are being poisoned and the seniors are being poisoned and it's just an absolutely critical health issue and those are vastly disproportionately black and brown communities if you travel around the country which i have done and i've done i quit my job eight years ago to really work on a series of environmental and justice issues including very prominently climate and if so if you want to get the right policy you need leadership and participation from day one from those communities and if you want to have the moral high ground you've got to have leadership and participation from those communities and there is a misconception in the public media that environmentalists and are people who look and have a background like the people on this call which is highly educated people who went to elite universities and have sort of a scientific and broad-minded understanding of what's going on in the natural world and how it infects people but if you look politically at this issue and you poll and you travel around and you talk to people the people who who are most likely to care and vote on climate clean energy clean air clean water environmentalism are latinos the number two group african-americans the number three group asian-americans and the only reason that native americans aren't in there is because they don't really poll native americans in most places because they're a low percentage of the population so all i'm saying is this from a political standpoint but also from a justice standpoint it's really important to deal with those issues and the biden plan does by specifically addressing the health issues and specifically setting aside jobs to make sure that as we rebuild the you know desperately needed rebuilding infrastructure of the united states to make sure that the jobs are allocated disproportionately the communities have been hurt so do you have enough constituencies aligned on that to make a majority and get things done yes so one thing you should also know mark is this now i know this may have been time-bound because it was right after a lot of publicity around the fires and the bad air in california record number of storms in the gulf but last week nvr did a poll that said for democratic voters the number one issue is climate this is not some it's true that in tomorrow's debate there is no climate question but it's also true this is the number one issue for democratic voters well that's a big huge gigantic but the other thing to know is this i'm a turnout we're going to talk politics for a second i know that you know a lot of the people on this call may well be scientifically driven on this but let's talk politics for one minute because we're five weeks away from a generational election i don't believe this election is about persuasion i assume that everyone on this call knows who he or she is voting for and there's nothing i can say to change that but what i also know is that young voters voted half the rate of other americans that they're the biggest most diverse most progressive group in american history and that that means there are tens of millions of people who agree that we should have a climate policy that it should be a progressive foreign policy that should look a hell of a lot like the biden plan and then talk about that this i agree um i mean is this the where our generation is in the process of handing our kids a mess a complete disaster and greta thornberg came across and got a little bit of attention for a sailing stunt and a lot of attention for a speech at the u.n that berated our generation is this the time when the dnc activates the next generation uh well i don't think it'll be the dnc to be honest mark but i think you know eight years ago i think i started the largest youth voter engagement organization in american history called next gen america and basically we think that if young people vote highest turnout ever is 52 in 2008. means for the biggest group of americans much bigger than the boomers half of them don't vote in the best of times and if they show up that's you don't have to persuade anyone to change their mind you just have to persuade people that their vote counts and that it's not too hard to vote and so that this election in my mind and you know obviously i'm talking my own book at some level because you know i thought this eight years ago and we spent eight years building up this organization to engage and you know empower young people but if they show up that changes everything politically this is a turnout election like 1932 or 1860 where you get to a place where people realize like there's something wrong here and people really care about it and some of them think one way and some of them think the other but the turnout goes through the roof that should happen this year i hope it does but all the evidence says it will because anti you said the votes have to count and we've got somebody out there saying well one is to have them cast and the other has them counted and i take your point mark but i also want to say one quickly just summarize the biden plan i mean the biden plan is two trillion dollars in four first four years and that's a lot of stuff obviously two trillion dollars is redoing commercial buildings hvacs weatherizing millions of houses building low-income housing building charging stations building rail you know really rebuilding the guts of american infrastructure it's a hundred percent clean electricity generation by 2035. so think about that for a second that's aggressive and necessary and it's a hundred percent carbon neutrality economy wide by 2050. so we all know that needs to happen and we're for it and how's it gonna you know what's the structure of how it gets paid for is it is this the time for a carbon tax is this the time for just government infrastructure spending i think well first of all i think like let's take a step back and talk about the economy i mean i started by saying that the risky business project was about putting the lie to the statement that its jobs are the economy the traditional republican opposition to clean energy which is like oh my god we have to destroy the natural world and kill ourselves or you know the economy will fall apart first of all that's statistically not true you know and the easiest way when when the clean air act was passed in 1970 business opponents claimed that it would cost trillions of dollars and all the analysis is it's saved trillions of dollars that has been a gigantic plus for the american economy and all of our analysis through risky business but all of everybody's analysis is oh my gosh rebuilding the economy is necessary right now we have high unemployment money is effectively the cheapest it's ever been in american history yeah so we have real need the ability to do it and honestly infrastructure that needs to be changed you know we obviously yeah let's say we get the coal out of the coal plants generating electricity who's going to who's going to get jobs for all the former coal miners and the rest so there is a huge issue about and this is a good both human point and let me say this about joe biden joe biden really cares about working people he specifically cares about working people working families union people people are trying to put food on the table and pay the rent and so he never talks about this without talking about this question which comes under the you know respecting the dignity of working people and protecting them so over the next 15 years we're moving to 100 clean generation but honestly this plan creates millions and millions of jobs i think about it a two trillion dollar infrastructure plan all over the united states of america now it's true we're gonna have to be especially careful to take care of workers in declining fossil fuel industries and that's been the pledge and so i'll say a couple things one is the largest energy union in the country is the international brotherhood of electrical workers the ibew and the president of that lonnie stevenson is part of the climate engagement advisory council which i co-chair and that he's a very long-term enthusiastic supporter of the vice president because he knows that joe biden really cares about working people he's confident that they're going to be a ton of jobs created i mean if you think about everything i'm talking about including bringing manufacturing back here those are all jobs for electricians and electrical work so okay let's say we get the job side of it you've got industry that's got you know electrical power plants that aren't depreciated yet stranded assets highly aware financial machines let me make one more point about obviously there are a ton more solar workers than co-workers right the number of people working i mean it doesn't mean we don't care about them because we do and it's incredibly important that we make sure that they're taken care of and held harmless but it's also true we're talking about millions and millions of net jobs so it's as i always say one theoretical job does not equal one real job where the person's getting paid this week what really counts is specific jobs for specific people and so that's a challenge to make sure that these are not the hollow political promises that people talk about that we're really delivering in a way including for the people in declining industries and that's a big part of this is to make sure that that in fact happens but sorry mark what was your let's go back what's the view i mean is this the time when a carbon tax or some kind of carbon pricing carbon policy you know i that is not part of the biden plan the biden plan is really about putting to creating the infrastructure to set it up so that american business can create the clean energy you know zero emission vehicles you know build the different products bit so that we bring manufacturing back here we create many more jobs than we're just talking about in terms of the infrastructure and we really are the point of the spear in terms of technology and change the way america that i mean that's how america's thrived is not by being the lowest cost commodity producer but by being the most innovative new producer in new things like clean energy when we look at this have they contemplated a carbon price it's literally it hasn't been part of the plan is it something that i know people are thinking about in washington d.c of course i know that but it but that is not part of the plan because what we need to do on very early and i'll explain why we need to make a real commitment domestically to clean energy and really leading the world in terms of creating the technologies that will let everybody succeed because you know this is a 15 american problem 85 percent non-american problem so if we are perfect and the rest of the world continues on its merry way emitting greenhouse gases we lose we all win or lose together but we we're not solving this problem without american leadership but we're not going to have credible american leadership after donald trump if we don't have somebody and joe biden has a lot of international experience in contacts and credibility but we need to make a commitment as a country we're going to do the right thing now we're asking you to do the right thing and there as you said mark this is not something we can get right 15 years from now this is an urgent time-bound issue about the deterioration of the natural world and what are we going to do about it and so you know i think we have we have to get this done very fast we have to get people to work very fast and then we have to go internationally with credibility and ask the other big emitters and our trade partners we're gonna have to do this together and this is what's gonna happen and we're gonna have to do something like paris but on steroids is there uh uh any particular parts of the plan that are geared towards sort of restarting cleantech investment there's a lot look there's a huge i'm sure people from all of the elite institutions who are on this call believe in research believe in science believe in engineering and entrepreneurship me too you know i look at those investments in research and i think oh my god that's what drives us that's the core of what enables us to out-compete and out-innovate everybody else and so i think the biden plan includes a ton more money for research i mean let's be clear the trump administration has done everything it can to cut r d everything it can you know if you don't believe in science why do you believe in scientific research i mean to be fair once you've decided that science doesn't matter you know not happening and so it's always been put back but his his budgets have always included massive cuts to all scientific research and especially including energy science research into energy projects so we um we have a whole bunch of great questions from the audience scary scary i want to let them um get featured here and get you to talk off the cuff about new new questions that came in some are great um one steps back a little bit and says you know um basically everything new these days has to get through the courts and ultimately the supreme court we lost rbg just recently the it's this is not the climate plan problem but it is the climate plan problem i understand who you deal um with what we're facing at this point i hear you sits and talks about this i mean mark right now the number one thing we can do for climate is elect joe biden and the number two thing we can do for climate is make sure the democrats take the senate and if you look at what i would think of as any kind of change in the court any ability to change the you know the the bench the federal bench the number one thing we can do to do that is elect joe biden and the number two thing we can do to do that is to flip the senate to the democratic side and i'm aware that they're probably republicans and democrats on this call and i understand that and i understand that i'm said something partisan but if you look at every single one of these issues on a strictly data mit completely objective basis that's the truth and if you look at the way the judges have voted how this administration has staffed treated energy epa paris it's very very consistent and it's very very consistent in the courts and so if i mean to me this is it's crazy to me that people would politicize science because not to be glib but i sort of thought we solved that in the 15th century and i i really did but we didn't and that's honest to goodness the issue that we're having now with covid it's the issue that we're having now with climate it it really is a question of what are the bases for thinking about fires what are the bases for thinking you know that the president came out here and said the reason for the fires is poor forest management okay there's some truth to that we could do a better job of managing our forests um you know i'm speaking to the mit club of northern california we know that's true we also know the federal government owns 57 percent of the forests he was lecturing the governor the state owns three percent of the forests it's like okay there's some truth to what you're saying but if you want to see who's not doing a great job of it you should look in the mirror but beyond that to think that it's a coincidence that the by far the worst fire season in california history followed the greatest heat wave in california history and to think that's a coincidence is crazy but it's no more crazy than thinking masks don't work on copen well my my daughter and my sister-in-law's families were both evacuated today we're in in napa yeah so there they're we all live this mark in our house we've all lived this either from fires or terrible air or just the fear of waking up in the morning that's right and go ahead we had some big progress this week and we had the the new edict that will have electric cars as the only thing sold in california in 2035 and that sets the standard for the rest of the world as the fifth largest economy goes electric um but but that's a step what what you know it's a great step what else has to happen is that enough well obviously let's but can we put it in perspective because in addition to working on the biden campaign i'm also the co-chair of the i think it's like jobs and employment or jobs and business task force for governor newsom and i was actually there for that announcement and to put it in perspective in california over half of the greenhouse gas emissions are either from transportation or from the extraction of fossil fuels for transportation over half so for us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions we have to go after transportation or else over 50 is going to just keep going and it's never gone down to be clear the overwhelming way that california has reduced our greenhouse gas emissions is by cleaning up electricity generation so that's something which is kind of progressing but if we're really going to do what we have to do we have to address this issue and let me make one slight um addendum to what you were saying mark it's not just electric vehicles what they were describing at adams was zero emission vehicles understanding that there could be a lot of real tech changes from mit stanford berkeley davis you know whatever ucsb grads into in technologies but in the next 15 years and onward to come up with different ways to get around and i think everybody has an image of what it's going to look like but you know i think there's going to be some surprises personally that are at least in in terms of popular conception of what it's going to look like in 2035 in terms of how we're going to get around but i think that that was a huge step forward because what it's going to do is mean that there are 34 people making electric vehicles in california he's basically saying there are 2 million cars right now that we buy per year in california we're 40 million people buying two we're the biggest state for cars i mean we're a real car culture but all those car companies have to buy 85 of their batteries from china so the question is can we be a manufacturing hub around zero emission vehicles can we be an innovation hub you were asking about the question about spending money on research absolutely can we do this and put california at the forefront not just of dealing with climate but also with manufacturing the clean energy products that we have to do and you know it's i think it's a very good idea from an economic standpoint our second biggest export as a state is electric cars that's our biggest manufacturing business electric cars so when people are talking about all these different things and all the different industries just be clear that is a place that is working for us clean energy is a place that's working for us from an economic basis doing this and putting us at the front of that getting people to come here to build for this market that is very good for californian job creation business creation product innovation research and development you know he's really doing in a much bigger way what i was trying to do back in 2007 which is to say let's get this innovation engine that has driven california in so many different industries in so many different ways revved up because we have to but it has a million great spin-offs including cleaning up the air and water in the communities where people have asthma and can't drink the water that's right so the electric cars are sexy they get a lot of attention a lot of visibility and that's great because they're half the problem as you say the other half is buildings and industry and stuff that's not so visible but and even includes natural gas um is the plan um also bringing focus and attention on to that sort of the built environment look yes look i think this first step was a first step so i don't want to i mean we're advisory to the governor i'm not the governor and so i know that they're thinking about all those things and they want to you know lead on it and i know that gavin look i don't think it's a coincidence we had the greatest fires in california history and ten days later there was a huge climate announcement i think it really brought home to gavin newsom the absolute emotional urgency of this for him and for everybody in california like oh my god you know your family's getting evacuated yeah and they're not unique i mean there have been 10 000 fires in california we've had three of the four biggest fires in california history in the last month this is you know a situation that is you know we started but you said it was urgent it's urgent and and i will say this i think that tech is better than anyone thought it would be at this point both in terms of where we are in the well-known technologies and kind of what we can see on the horizon for new technologies that could turn out to be really really differential and important so i think that's better than anybody would have thought two years ago or five years old for sure but the impact of the change in temperature on fires on storms in the gulf on the disintegration and melt of glaciers in greenland and antarctica is also worse than any would have said two years or five years ago substantially worse and i that's what i hear from scientists including friends of mine who've worked on this for 30 years who said you know honestly i knew this was a problem but i thought that what we're seeing now in the physical world we'd see 10 years from now so we need to play that leadership role you're talking about and do the right thing um what's the you know to what extent and it's hard for us to force things but sell things to our international collaborators to get china india brazil and the rest of the crowd because as we see you'll launch a smoke plume in california and it goes all the way around the world pretty fast in many and that's a great symbol too right like that's a symbol of how it works well let me say this if you look at the countries of the world that are going to suffer you just name some of the ones that are going to suffer almost beyond human capacity to imagine you know if you look at the dependence of asia on the melt from the glaciers in the himalayas and then look at what they expect to happen to the glaciers in the himalayas you really kind of want to go you want to forget you ever did that work if you look at what happens to sea rise and the level of countries where hundreds of millions of people live you want to forget that as fast as possible and you know i think americans have a misconception about the numbers of people that live in different countries based on how often those countries get covered in the press so if you said to most people which is bigger thailand in population thailand or norway they would say you know they're approximately the same size and one of them's four million people and one of them's 80 million people and you know it's just dramatic in terms of population and you can look at websites that show which places in the world are most susceptible to climate change and if you go and look we have there's a reason mark why the leaders of china and india should want to work with us particularly as the technology is cheaper for clean energy and more effective and so it's a huge deal that these lines cross which they have crossed in electricity generation it's a huge deal that these lines cross in terms of cost for zero emission vehicles furnace internal combustion vehicles so how can you have a trade war with the same folks you're trying to collaborate with you know i think that is an actually really important question because the question is can you collaborate on something that threatens the health and lives of every one of your citizens at the same time that you are in an ideological struggle away from that in terms of economic leadership is to reframe your question a little bit well let me say this mr trump has not just fought with people who he sees as our competitors or adversaries he's fought with our best friends he's made it clear you know he's withdrawn from the world health association during a pandemic he's withdrawn or as fast as he could from the paris accord during a climate crisis so it's very clear that the management that we have right now to the extent that it depends upon international cooperation american trustworthiness and leadership is in reverse and we can see how that works and so what is it possible for us to do i think is a very fair question but i know that the answer to that is completely different with someone who has the trust of the international com uh community experience acting around the world being tough but fair which is what americans have striven to be and also being someone who cares about doing the right thing which is people act as if trust doesn't matter like there are laws and you know all that matters is laws and force that's not true that's not true at all you know we did not win the cold war by bombing the heck out of people we won the cold war by showing that we had a better system that worked better for people around the world and that we that that was something was going to make their lives better and those despotic leaders couldn't stand up to it took a while we've got two quick um political questions and then i have a couple of last questions to to to get you on here oh good market so so there's a question here that says um what kinds of policies and legislation what moves could garner bipartisan support is there anything well you know it mark i mean the question let me rephrase that question if i could of course what will change republican first of all republi republican voters want clean energy overwhelmingly republican voters know why climate's happening republican electeds don't think the people who vote for them care enough to change their vote and therefore they think it's a free option to support the fossil fuel industries who give them a third of their money and i hate to sound so cut and dried but that's the truth because it is impossible that half the elected officials or more in our federal government can't read they can read they know this they're not stupid this is a decision so the question is what will change that decision that is a political decision not a scientific judgment not an engineering judgment not a judgment on economics it is a political judgment based on their own interest what will change it is when they think it isn't in their own interest anymore if they think that they're going to lose their job for standing up and opposing progressive energy laws they will support progressive energy laws like that but if they think they're going to lose the other half and if they don't think it's in their self-interest they won't do it so if we go out and show that people who oppose progressive energy laws environmental justice and the safety of the natural world will lose you'll get a lot of republican votes the other half of the question was exactly that how can we all um figure out who the people are we have to make a difference what if we have 36 days ballots have already been sent out in a lot of states people are voting in a lot of states this is a you got to vote you got to get your friends and families to vote you've got to support candidates that can make a difference and you've got to volunteer if you can and so on it people always sit there and go like i have no agency what my brother called me up about two years ago i can't sleep you know i'm too upset about what's going on in the country it's going the wrong way i can't sleep and i said look the antidote to anxiety and fear is action it's amazing do a few things and it's like now you're in the fight and you relax it's like okay something's wrong i'm taking action on the side of trying to right that wrong and i now i'm not so anxious because i'm in it and i i truly believe we have 36 days to make a difference and do what americans you know the old winston churchill saying americans always do the right thing after they try everything else we have you know he was sitting there waiting for us to come in in world war ii waiting and waiting and waiting and here we are we've tried everything else we have 36 days to do the right thing we all have to participate we all have agency and we have to show up and that's exactly where we are and then afterwards we have to support change and progressive energy change or it's not going to get done so we got two two really good questions and i decided to make them the last okay mark the next to last is is the question kind of they titled it climate science is it too late you know have we already blown past a degree and a half or two degrees have we already blown past the ppms we can have in the in the atmosphere i mean obviously when you have when you have these kind of fires in california and these kind of storms in the gulf and you this you know i view the economy and the progress of the world on environmentalism it's it's like and i know this is an overused analogy so i'll apologize in advance it's it's like a big steamer there's no you can't just hit the brakes there's a ton of momentum we're going this way and we're already dealing with huge issues i mean i just named three of them sea rise storms based on the temperature of the water heating up that's why we have record number of storms and fires and we haven't talked about a lot of other natural world issues including extinction and species you know disappearance is it too late it's never too late because it's clear now that we're in a situation where we're gonna have to deal we're gonna have to adapt to real issues to people being burned out to you know extremes of temperature you know look i know it was the hottest temperature ever recorded was last month in death valley but the one that got me and i assume a lot of the people here from california was 120 degrees in san luis obispo i mean that just doesn't compute i know it's a mediterranean climate it just doesn't make any sense so are we going to be able to avoid climate issues no we're having climate issues and we have momentum behind that so that we can't just hit the brakes and stop can't so we're going to have to act urgently change it as fast as we can and then we're going to have to figure out how to sequester no question in my mind yeah and are we going to be able to do that yes experimental i know we're not there i'm highly aware that we're not there but in order for us to get back to a place of mark it's just true we're going to have to talk you know i have a friend from northern california who wants to plant a trillion trees okay i'm just saying a trillion trees oh that's a lot of trees that's a long tree so we're gonna have to get there so the answer is is it too late it's never too late but are we in fact too late to avoid painful outcomes of climate change we are too late we're having painful outcomes of climate change clearly and the question is will we deal with them urgently to prevent them from getting substantially worse or are we going to be the frog that lets itself get boiled alive because it's too difficult to reach over and turn down the stuff that's the question so the good news is as much as the last question was a downer we had somebody say here's the last question this is really the question that says can you give us some hope yeah there is there a positive way of looking at this i'll say definitely you know how to deal with it so so let me say one thing i said before the tech is here if you go and look at what it costs to create a kilowatt hour of electricity solar and wind are cheaper and going to get a lot cheaper if you look at where the costs are going to go on cleantech lower than dirty fuel lower than than internal combustion engines the tech is really good and so we can do this we are and it's going to get better america the people on this call are smart 320 million americans are smart the question here is can we make this happen politically and let me say this we can we must and i think the right way to think about this is look do you really think that your ancestors had it so easy like they weren't dealing with life and death we're talking about life and death and you know what yes it's real and if we blow it it's irrecoverable so let's not blow it and that's been true for every generation for 25 000 years everyone on this call your ancestors were sitting on a in a cave scared to death of what was outside and having to figure out what to do about it and it was life and death and we're here and now we have to sit here and figure out what to do about this we're capable of doing this so here's a challenge like don't think about it like woe is me think about it it's the real world we have a real world challenge it really matters you have to show up yeah you know what that's called life it really matters that you do the right thing it really matters that you try it really matters that we're smart and don't give up yeah that's an opportunity to have a meaningful life don't feel bad that's what you got put on the planet to do this right now great opportunity don't feel bad let's just go do it and we're a link in the chain let's be a strong link in the chain well we're very glad that we have somebody with vision and guts to lead that thank you very much it's a great pleasure to be with you mark thank you so much for having me appreciate your time your thoughts and we wish you huge success thank you very much thank you thank you all i hope this was useful i want to turn it over to doug spring to

terrific um it's really been fun to appreciate this first virtual event that we had and these guys are really dominating getting us started in our virtual season and there we go clean energy future reviewing what's happened in the past and then talking about some of the uh exciting opportunities that are lying ahead to get us moving continually along with this source of environment so about the galaxy as a leader happens and then for science and technology and he's going to talk also about climate change policy but he's going to be able to post election analysis and so we're going to be hearing basically what his acceptance [Music] administration during a period where this would be actively discussed and thank you so much for joining us
