all right welcome everybody happy uh thursday afternoon out here uh i'll uh just do a couple quick open remarks for the mit finance track i also wanted you to point out we have some events coming up we had a great happy hour yesterday uh and we we have we'll do more of those where we'll have thematic a little breakouts in there and uh got some great events we've got a a techstars founded company going to teach us about estate planning um we've got year end we've got a mit alums going to do a financial swim test for you guys swim test training so anyway so uh real quick about the mit club for those of you not aware um so we basically close to 16 000 alum many events it's all volunteer-led so you know please uh please jump in and get involved guys there's a lot of great stuff we can do um but i will i'm gonna turn it over to arnold now the moderator for the event and uh take and i'll let you take it from here arnold um hi everybody uh welcome for joining us for this uh event this afternoon i appreciate taking the time um uh i'm uh working as a volunteer for the mit uh club alone california of this event and also i i also volunteer for a professional group called the asian financial society each financial society has been active for more than 30 years and is based probably of new york so i think this is a great opportunity to bring together uh professionals from uh financing technology and also from east coast and west coast so uh this will be a a new uh uh event format that we'll be trying now so um i i look forward to a very exciting discussion with professor pentland uh myself i've worked in the both um software technology and finance uh both on wall street and government and um i i learned about budget fund from the ai conference earlier this year and read about his uh very interesting work developing this concept on data union so um so we have more conversation and i think this is a this is a a novel concept that might help power some of the future um let's say revitalization revitalization or reinvention of our um uh community that we're going to need coming out of the slow down we're hitting the covert crisis currently so i'm very eager to start the conversations and um please remember that this event is being recorded and will be available for viewing later uh on and we will have a chat function for you to enter in any questions you may have and uh we will um collate them uh presented to professor at the appropriate time um the two in a session the second half of the uh of the event so um let me give a brief introduction to personal pantolon i think many of you uh know him already yeah he has been well known and very active in the mit community being one of the co-founder for the mit media lab and he's also voted a lifetime achievement award from the mit club earlier this year too so um aside from the many uh software uh innovations uh he is uh taking a fall leadership positions in uh these areas of intersection between technology and community and so i look forward to learning much more about this uh today so um please oppose the president uh all right the stage is yours okay so i'm going to give about a 20-minute sort of overview this idea uh it really changes the way you think about hopefully the way you think about finance and investing and data in various ways so i'm going to do a little bit of powerpoint here just to get started let's see what we got here okay and make it work okay so there we i am uh i'm very proud of the little drawing that's by the person that does all those drawings in the in the new yorker and i run a group at uh mit i'm both in the media lab and in engineering the connection science is the one in engineering and it's a an alliance of large uh corporations but also international organizations and uh countries so we have several countries that are members trying to think about uh how do you do privacy preserving identity systems uh safe computing and and how you use that stuff so just a little advertisement what we do is develop open source pre-standard software um the very first thing from our group was uh kerberos we managed the open source kerberos implementation 85 percent of all authentication on the web came out of things we do we helped develop open id connect and and mobile id and recently we spun up a nash to help spend up a national system for switzerland which is a blockchain system for data exchange medical financial et cetera which is pretty interesting we had a spin out that was supported by fidelity called akoya which is for moving retirement benefits and other investments around between major banks without revealing personal data on necessarily and we work with intuit on some of their internal systems which are uh secure uh uh privacy preserving uh systems um so i like this little uh uh cartoon you know google and facebook drilling for oil because data is the new oil all that sort of silliness but the serious part is is that people don't trust data and ai in the economy don't trust it to act in their interest so you hear all this stuff about bias and the robot overlords and so forth and there's real concern and you're seeing this in litigation and the government acting uh today uh people want to have a more of a sense of control and trust particularly in outcomes of how data is used uh so it's like i don't really care if you have my data but it depends what you use it for right i want that to be in my interest not necessarily only in your interest and a phrase i developed many years ago is a new deal on data so a new way of thinking about data new regulation about it i ran a group at davos for the world economic forum that ended up creating gdpr and it was about the idea that people should be able to know what's happening to their data and have some control over that and of course like all legislative processes it's complicated uh california's law is a little better uh we'll see we'll get to the promised land someday but i'll tell you a little bit how to to get to a better place with data and finance uh and this little talk so the the key from my point of view is to think of data like capital labor and land it's a primary method of production and if you look at capital you look at labor you look at land these are all regulator regulated they're all things that are audited they're all things where there are ownership rights necessarily full ownership but but but ownership rights ability to control and um i think capital has uh uh certain data has entered this the set of major fundamental production uh uh characteristics or methods and i'll quote thomas pedicky who i would pick nits with on several things but one of the things he said is large returns to capital is not bad in itself the problem is that it's in too few hands and i'll just substitute the word data there's nothing wrong with data being really profitable or really effective it's just it needs to be spread around so that profit that that control can be in in many more hands and that's really the the key thing uh to do this just like we do with finance just like we do with land just like we do with labor uh there need to be new institutions uh to make this happen so things we have to guarantee with data are digital identity what is the data about you that's your digital identity and ownership rights ability to know about it control it you don't have uniform ownership of it because much of it's co-created but you at least have some rights in there you have the ability to audit and accountability and gdpr and the california law are steps in this direction and we work with a number of people to actually make this real and i'll mention that a little later on and of course if you screw up that people do bad things they ought to you know pay for it in one way or another and too often that doesn't happen now or only happens in trivial ways so um how to do this well there's history here in the 1870s most of america was rural they felt they were being raked over the coals by banks local banks there was no federal bank at that point and and uh what they did is they formed agricultural uh banks that they owned and they controlled and uh that resulted in this sort of political pushback uh and eventually we got banking laws and the fed and the whole nine yards which which cleaned up a lot of it in the 1900s 1920s the same was true of labor as industrialization came in because the people were moving off the land into cities uh there was this feeling like a few big corporations controlled everything and exploited labor so people formed into local uh collectives called data unions sorry about data called unions and they pushed back and over time the government got involved and new sort of standards were established about you know how much you work and safety and things like that and i think the same thing is beginning to happen and will happen in data so people coming together uh to make or what i'll call data unions you could also call them data cooperatives but um the idea here is is that under current law things like uh credit unions and cooperatives can hold data for people so not own it but usually deposit it the same way you deposit money in a bank and that if they do that they can then quote unquote invest it for you and that investment is not really about money so there have been a number of things where people talk about i want money for my data well excuse me but that's stupid it's a couple hundred bucks a month at most it's actually more like a couple hundred bucks a year but i would like to know that the hospital system is treating my community right and that my kids will survive right or that i'll survive the pandemic and a lot of times that's not true because i don't know what's happening about service delivery in my area i don't know that the government is treating me right i don't know that all sorts of things about my circumstance and if i aggregate data i can begin to determine what's happening to me and the people nearby did the school work is the is it a safe environment etc etc and begin to push for for change based on the facts but you can't do that unless you have the data so that's the core ideas is this notion of empowering communities by having them collect their data not give their data up and these data unions may eventually act as brokers and actually have monetary return but i don't think that's the major value of these so let me just sort of illustrate a little bit about why you should care and the investment financial side of it so um you know what we're talking about is within a community people deposit their data and this is trivial from a i.t point of view you just have a feed off your phone off your mint account things like that to a bank credit union a co-op that holds it for you and helps you administer your data and what it lets you do is make measurements about your community and how you do relative to your community and how the big powers in this world are treating your community we have a simple example of this that we're doing for adelaide in australia if you look at opportunity.mit.edu and it just shows things like well okay for people in this neighborhood where do they work where do they shop how much money do they spend what about their health is this something that is a very diverse community or is it not and that matters let me just tell you a little bit more about the data that we're collecting there and the data that we're using for several other things which i'll mention it's really much like census data so you deposit individual level data that's aggregated and you can say well here's the average income here's the rate of breast cancer here's the how the kids are doing in school and so you get statistics about your census block your community and one of things is different than government statistics today is that you can also do flows of people those are things like where do the people in your community work um how much do they work how do they get there what who comes to your community to buy things that's another sort of important thing so again it's like census data it's not individual level data but let me show you some of the things that you can do once you know the statistics about your community and the flows between communities so for instance in four continents we've looked at many different cities it turns out that the biggest predictor of year-on-year economic growth for communities you know i'm talking about the whole country for a neighborhood a census block is the diversity of people that visit that community and that's almost equivalent to the diversity of stores and other amenities what that's telling you is is that if you want to make a neighborhood richer you have to have diverse amenities and you have to have the transportation to bring diverse sorts of people there and if you do that with extremely high likelihood the gdp earned in your neighborhood will go up in fact you can do something that's really pretty amazing you can do estimation of sales for stores that don't exist and you can do it as accurately as if the store had already been there so let me break that down so we can say using this sort of flow data say if i put a say a a small food store or bodega or something right here what will the sales be three months or a year out and we can do that as accurately as a current store can with its historical data what that does is that gives you financial viability of different investments and in fact we combine this with historical data in some cases or other sorts of data you can do considerably better than is possible today so that's pretty interesting for investment and as i mentioned there's this opportunity website we've shown that you can do things like identify poverty hot spots you can do better much better design of transportation systems so for instance in senegal we showed that you could make the transportation system work something like 10 to 15 better with zero additional cost you just rerouted the buses and things to actually match demand you can do public health something that would have been a great thing to have had about a year ago and you can do investment and do much better job at predicting where investments will pay off and where they won't so uh and here's one that's particularly relevant it turns out you can predict surges in covid so where which is going to be a hot spot next week two weeks from now you can do really a surprisingly good job of that all things you might care about more than a couple hundred bucks a year so what are we beginning to do well first of all probably half of you or more are saying well this is all nice but this is some idealistic idiocy um so i'll just point out to you that uh 56 of the electric grid in the united states was not built by a government it was not built by power companies it was built by cooperatives as these are america's electric cooperatives communities that hey that electric electricity stuff's pretty good let's put together a cooperative to build it pay it off and maintain it and that's where most of electric grid in america came from you can imagine doing the same thing for internet why not right um we work with other things so we work with the credit union national association uh so what these are is these are credit unions that are have a mission of being beneficial for their community they're local they're not like the big broad you know uh national ones and we can help them make better much better loan decisions if they can get their members to contribute data to help the investments that they make which is obviously going to have a dual bottom line first of all their neighborhood is going to get better because there may have been more diverse amenities but also the interest that's paid on their money not just their data but on their money will be better we're working with consumer union to be able to verify digital claims and give people rights to their data working with various sorts of unions including sort of gig workers uh because it's crazy pig workers are fully digital the data's there on their phone why can't they tell what they're getting paid and and and what the situation is and when the black box algorithm changes why can't they tell what's going on well it turns out that you can scrape that data off of their phone and tell how they're being paid and what's going on and uh they have the legal right to that also so one of the things i set up recently you might be interested is law.mit so that's an alliance of law schools that think about computational law how do you actually update law and make law more adaptive and more suited to these digital things and the final one i'll mention is open music so this is an alliance with many uh uh musicians music schools and some music producers uh to create a blockchain system that where people can log their data in this case their performance status their music along with copyright info and automagically license data directly without going through a lot of the normal distribution channels or you could if you wanted to of course um but it's it's the sort of thing that promises to really revive the recording and the video industry um so enabling this is not difficult you can do this with an excel spreadsheet and a local survey but you can also do it in a sort of a high-tech way and we've designed systems like our trade coin system you can see that it was uh featured in the royal society proceedings recently but recently we helped the swiss set up something called swiss trust chain so this is a blockchain system a little bit like libra uh but for managed by the swiss so you can trust it uh put up by swisscom and swiss post to be able to manage digital rights digital transformation so that's medical financial etfs things like that uh ownership shares all sorts of things on this fully digital auditable program we also work with monetary authority in singapore and this is very interesting so their sovereign wealth fund has invested in creating a similar facility for use by its investments in the indian ocean area so temasek has almost a trillion dollars worth of investment out in that area and they're hoping to move all those logistics chains the various sorts of financial things to this new uh uh facility which is called ubin so look it up singapore ubin and see what you think um so that's it i have a book about this which uh arnold talked about uh building a new economy um it's a work in progress at mit press which means it's on the web and it's free so you can go look at it if you want and it'll be on kindle in a couple months the spell checkers have to go through it and stuff like that so i'll just stop there and let's talk thanks hey that's a great introduction to we appreciate it and i see a lot of the uh um enthusiastic uh inquiries coming through the chat box too so um one thing that is uh suddenly very relevant uh attend the appointment is that the different datas have varying the amount of quality depending on the natural collections and the different provenance and the consistency issue um what would you say is a good way to address these type of data quality issues well in the things that we've done you know it's not quite the same problem you get in a company um because in a company you're trying to do some often very complicated internal transaction data or customer data mostly what we're looking at are outcome data so you know what what are the you know three geo codes that have the most purchasing of the people in this cooperative in this neighborhood or uh what are the uh the zip codes of the people that purchase things in this uh this neighborhood or you know how often do the people in this neighborhood visit the hospital and you can get data like that with extremely high accuracy yeah there's always some bugs and stuff like that but it's not a it's not a major problem at least in our experience so i see the question about hipaa right so remember that we're not giving data away what we're doing is we're saying we have a repository where you can put data like your medical data which is hipaa covered and store it there and i saw a comment by somebody else who has a startup like that my life data or something so that's entirely illegal you control that data you can get a copy of it sometimes that's difficult but you can get a copy and you can put it there and then you can agree just like a research study to have people answer certain questions about the aggregate data and make visible things like how often is there breast cancer in this neighborhood so for instance there's a neighborhood in our area where somebody did that and they discovered that the weed killer that the grass guys were using caused breast cancer and there was a higher than usual incidence of breast cancer in their their neighborhood well that's pretty amazing you'd like to know that right but it's only possible by uh collecting data that's normally not in the possession of a of a community i also sort of point out that there's a couple things here that i didn't mention one is is that data-driven investment local investment is a lot more can be a lot more lucrative and reliable than heuristic things which is the way it's typically done um the other sort of thing is is that the uh the handling of the data here is well within existing laws you know you might get some challenge sometimes but you're on the side that's going to win and data's worth a lot more when it's in aggregate than it is when it's individual level data so by having these repositories you can get much more leverage at all sorts of things than if you are only isolated individuals who are coordinated hey uh professor let me uh use my monitor privilege to ask you a question about the um some of these little community development ideas you have kind of reminds me of many of the um uh local economic currency that people have tried in different things like ethical dollars and with the idea of trying to preserve and maintain tablet accumulation circulation within the community uh i see some similar spirit in in the steady union what you're working on the do you feel that called alternative currencies and um you know the most famous and successful one is called the veer w-i-r in switzerland it's created during the great depression land owners in western switzerland uh pledged assets to support an alternative currency that could be used for projects to build infrastructure in western switzerland so they sort of bootstrapped themselves and that currency is still going on it was a very successful way for them to get through the depression and through world war ii and it's still useful to them the thing about something like that is is that it's more complicated to set up than what i'm talking about you have to bootstrap the currency typically that requires local government to do things like demand that taxes be paid partially in the local currency you have to advertise about it this is this just requires people to click on a button to get some software to have their their data account it can be with an existing institution like a credit union that they already trust and then the part that's difficult about this is you have to have people that analyze the data on the basis of what the community wants you want to have sort of democratic governance of that and what we're seeing is we're seeing i'm seeing people like consumer union a number of large investment firms and a number of banks and other entities are gearing up to provide those sorts of facilities to enable communities to make better investments i mean they're going to put the seed money in so they'll get good return on investment and they'll probably end up charging for this management of community data but they don't own the data and uh it's in their interest to make it as simple as possible i've talked to the heads of several major banks and several major uh who have all these quite useless bank branches right i'm trying to go what are we going to do right and i did mention all the the community credit unions who are also looking for things to do and of course labor unions are looking for things to do i think we have a question from travis hi there yeah hi hi professor thanks for your time today um i'm curious if you have worked at all with tim berners-lee's solid project it was at mit until i think 2015. the personal online data stores feel like a really interesting primitive for data unions and just curious what your thoughts are there yeah you could do that that's actually um i'm generally so the thing about solid so this is a way of building the web where you've got linked to data the the weakness of that is that the semantics of all of the links have to be uniform otherwise you've got garbage links right and so it's very hard to do out of existing data stores but if you're building a new structure it's great right so for instance i think what you just said is is a is a great use of it because you can by setting it up guarantee that the semantics of the columns are what you intended them to be and then it gives you this secure private uh controllable way of managing the data so there's two types of general approach there i don't know if you guys are interested in this there's there's that sort of thing where you do it uh by design so the semantics are right and then there's the other sort of more machine learning thing that's referred to as federated learning where you can tolerate a lot more noise and use pre-existing data stores but you're not actually taking data out of the data store great thank you so much i believe that mary has a question for you i mean it's cara sorry hi yeah again professor pentland thanks for being here um so i my husband actually brought this up when you were talking about the analogy to um the electricity grid that he's from rural texas we still have a lot of family in arkansas oklahoma texas and you know when phones were new there were party lines and pretty soon atm t came in and sort of took everything over and there was a lot of um resource capture sort of legislation that helped att take over in the case of electric grid my understanding it was similar it's still really frustrating now that broadband is terrible you're like standing on your car in the middle of town trying to get a sell signal which is it's sort of amazing the small companies haven't come in well i think what's happened is small companies have come in but then there's sort of lobbying from the majors and different pressure that they remove the smaller companies from the rural areas and so extending the analogy the question is here there's a lot of existing players that are using data and sort of like the way things are running and so sort of what's the legal oom for what's the path to protecting any nascent effort that does provide people the ability to join data unions and prevent it from sort of being squashed by resource capital those are great questions so the um there's probably two answers to this one is i think you know what's probably going to happen which is that this is fundamentally political just like labor unions and labor law i mean there was huge resistance to having rules about labor and safety and things like that and you know it was a battle but the thing that tipped it eventually was you got enough citizens joining enough entities these unions or whatever the government had to pay attention and they passed laws despite the lobbying from the other side and obviously it was sort of a big battle probably the same type of thing needs to happen now so so there are already uh cooperatives and and things like that that are you know it's in their courts in their charter they're often uh you know determined that's why they're there to advocate for the community right now communities have no way to advocate because they don't know anything about their data their situation if they could show value for that if they show up at the state house whatever the the city hall they can begin to be heard on a factual basis so it's not just opinion it's it's something that's harder much harder to ignore in the long run um you talk about att and people like that um one of the big issues right now is anti-trust regulation for say google et cetera right and we just had a paper that was in the national academy and on that and showing that um the way people are talking about antitrust today won't work this is not like breaking up standard oil which was a localized business ties to the physical world now the the network benefit network synergy means that if you break up google you're going to get two companies that are nearly as big and the problem's going to be worse what you need to do is you need to encourage the grassroots and competition and there's several ways to do that one is stop acquires right and and certain sorts of competitive merging which is of course you know like one of my former students has bought something like 350 companies for google so no don't do that i don't allow that i'm sure he'll be disappointed but you know it's trying to shape the entire ecosystem so the ecosystem's much more competitive there are other ways to do it which are more controversial in this country so for instance the oecd is looking at a digital tax so if you have customers in a country but no physical presence often you can avoid taxes but somebody still has to pay for the hospitals and somebody still has to pay for the roads and somebody still has to pay for the schools and that's the motivation around attacks that rely uh attached to uh to digital services and that's going to be a big battle but you can imagine that um if you if your company doesn't pay taxes sort of a reasonable amount of taxes where your customers are that that that's a problem and uh and what that would do if you implemented that type of a thing is that local companies uh which already pay tax through uh employees and things like that would it be have cheaper services locally and locally might be your whole state right and and they could have a chance to grow into some sort of real company before they had to compete with the big guys so there's a couple things like that tax policy which is more like what the oecd is doing this uh reducing uh purchasing of competitive small companies um you know these are these are difficult problems but those are some of the ideas that that we've come up with did you give any examples of medical data unions that are already out there and operating there are some um they suffer from a couple different things um you know patients like me for instance has done a really bang-up job for rare diseases i think uh the main and what that points to is is that one of the main problems is you need to have a good sampling of the population to be able to say anything definite so if you're looking at a rare neurological disease you you know people are highly motivated to sign up and and you get enough of the fraction of the patients that you can actually say things that are are you know provably significant right that the medical associations have to pay attention to you can also do things that are population health though if i could get 10 of the people even in a neighborhood i could talk about prevalence of diabetes i could talk about prevalence of cancer i could talk about and that's enough to begin to really have arguments about public health services and other sorts of things and um but it's a sample at the end it's the sampling problem you have to get a cr this is the same thing with all sort of data analytics you have to get enough of a sample to be able to know that you can make a firm statement about something that's my view on it there are some other problems like for instance why doesn't data from drug trials get aggregated well it's because different people own the drug trials but there are now mathematical techniques for combining that data so for instance one of the efforts i'm involved in is getting an alzheimer's drug because there's enough data out there to really have strong statements about what works and what doesn't work but it's in different hands and everybody to that point one of the issues that comes up is compliance if you look at alltrials.com they go on and bemoan the fact that all this money is being given by governments for clinical trials and none of the results are being reported if you go to clinicaltrials.gov for example and click the reported data tab it's empty for a large number of the things that are there yeah it's crazy right and and and again that has to do with sort of data rights if you're part of a trial you ought to there ought to be a way you can log all that stuff and similarly they don't log um interactions very well at all even after the things approved uh so it's like there's crazy stuff and and i think that that we could do so much better if we had just a little bit of sensible regulation but also this sort of uh consumer-centered aggregation i'll say consumer but because i don't want to say patient because you know we're all going to be patient someday you know we want to put that off as long as possible um i believe that kathy has a question [Music] yes thank you yeah it is very much related to i guess some of the discussions that uh k robinson brought up about um you know large companies moving in and also with the idea that um when you talk about how powerful this data is i really see the attraction of data unions um and also the need to have like the need to have aggregated data like data is much more powerful for decision making if you have more of it and people are cooperating but one of the concerns i have and i wonder what your thoughts are are on this is how do you address the lack of trust that will tend to develop between these individual data unions like will they actually have issues where they will not want to share their data with other you know little data fighters and say you know we're not sharing because we don't trust you enough to do the right thing with our data or because you're undervaluing our data i'm a little worried about these the fragmentation and creation of data silos in a different way right so so one of the things i don't know if you guys are familiar with federated learning you don't actually have to share data in fact if you are doing something that involves sharing data you've probably made a mistake what you can do is you can do local computations that produce essentially feature vectors that cannot be related back to individuals and then you can aggregate the feature vectors to be able to get global insights the most brilliant version of this it runs on your cell phones where you know there's this thing called swipe which is how you type really really fast on a phone and and that's updated by there's a little local machine learning produces a feature vector they then randomly flip the bits in the feature vector so it's junk they send it to home some central place and it turns out if you add all of those feature vectors up the noise cancels out so now you can say what was the average you know performance of these phones across and they do this for hundreds of millions of phones right uh quite regularly you say well the average performance but provably there's no way to know what was happening on any particular phone and then you would do you send updates to the average performance back to the phones and so nobody knows whether you're using that even right so there are ways of doing this that are um sort of not the way humans normally think about things and i think that that's a sort of a great hope the other thing is you know like for instance credit unions in in this country country uh they invest in pools so the entire northeast every credit union has the same pool uses the same pool of investment they use the same type of software uh you know because they're too small to do anything big by themselves and so they get not money from it but they get expertise and management from it all right so there's a there's a path forward and you're good to worry about that but but i think that um that's that's pretty directly um addressable especially if you i mean if you start with high trust uh entities right like credit unions and things like that and i know they're a little tired and so far i know there's problems with them right some of them are sold out etc but yeah okay we have two more good questions coming up uh since just a reminder buddy or coming near the end of the oh please ask a question quickly um mr jason uh dunlop can you please ask a question uh thank you uh for the presentation tonight it's great to uh join in from the uk uh over in wales uh great to see different paradigms and different views i just wonder if you've done any work on the future value of uh personal data and how you see that world growing changing or staying as it is so um well if you're interested in it we have an article in slow management review about data exchanges so one of the problems with data today is that there's no really good market way to value it i mean independent of who controls it who gets the value you know is it surveillance or what you know you can't really discover the value and what we're seeing what i'm seeing is the rise of these things which do not share data but allow insights to be computed on the data which is essentially what i'm talking about with with a cooperative so what you do is if you want to know something you go to one of these exchanges and you say i'd like to know this here's the algorithm i want to run on the telco data and the other sort of data and they look through it and make sure it doesn't violate any privacy laws or things like that and because it's a sort of competitive type of a thing you end up with markets and market mechanisms that value things and you know so it's uh it it allows uh for much more fluidity and use of data in the aggregate uh without endangering individual privacy and you have to be able to have governance of this so you know you can imagine a world where it's all run by data and humans aren't involved you know our robot overlords and obviously you need to have rules about that and we have some rules about that but there need to be um sort of institutions for managing that the way we manage our uh our dollars and pounds right there's a central bank there's people that look at inflation there's people that look at fraud uh and and things like that and and it's going to take that because it's a means of production it's a major factor in value creation so people are going to do all sorts of crazy things and you got to make sure that they don't thank you that's really insightful thank you so let's let's keep it quick the uh mr sumit sandhil hi um yeah thank you for taking the question um the question is generally on climate and natural resources right so that's the biggest existential threat to the planet yet the data is still very siloed right the government opens it up but then the black rocks and others are computing you know risk and local risk and hyper local risk but nobody else has access to that so how do we go about unsellowing it from those that have the bandwidth to compute insights well i think there's there's two types of uh answer run um i mean let's let me just point out that if you know there's a hundred million people that are members of um uh data sorry mono credit unions in the united states if they also had their data you could do really pretty amazing things because that's a good sample of the u.s in terms of the sort of data you're talking about um it's a little bit like the drug discovery problem where there's these owners of data and they only let it out in certain ways that are high value for them and the rest of us just don't know what's happening um so it's nice that there are now ways to compute things that allow you to do big statements about the aggregates or about not necessarily everything but you could do state by state or even in some cases city by city um where it doesn't reveal proprietary information or personal information and still be able to see what's going on so so the argument all we can't share because it's proprietary or personal is really quite weak now just like it is in medicine it's now just you know people want to own it and what that argues is you need to have some sort of uh regulation or standard about this in in many countries uh like britain is one of the the leading ones there's a very strong open data regulation and they actually have the law that allows them to seize data like that and make it public and they haven't done much of that at all but the laws on the books and and i'm a big believer in that sort of open data there needs to be much more rich data about society about sustainability and so forth i'm on the board of directors for the un's sustainable development goals data effort which is exactly that there ought to be sort of neighborhood by neighborhood measurements of all these sorts of things poverty inequality sustainability etc etc and that ought to be for the whole world and progress is being made but of course it's slow and frustrating the good news is that because of various other pressures the oecd is proposing a very detailed version of the sustainable development data goals for companies and for tax authorities the big four accounting forms have have lobbied for and proposed very concrete measurements like what you're talking about because they have to be able to audit companies right and data is now being put on the books not off the books so and risks of those sorts are being built into the financial incentives so there's hope um i won't say it's a done deal but um just this morning for instance i was uh uh the conclusion of this uh set of meetings that i've been running for this is i think this is slightly hilarious there's turns out there's a club which is all the former presidents and prime ministers in the world right it's called the world leadership alliance who knew right and and they get together and have policy discussions and i was leading the discussion on digitization and this is exactly the sort of topic that they're talking about and and there was really sort of an overwhelming feeling that what we need is something that's very much like bretton woods so at the end of world war ii there was these bretton wood accords that set up the u.n and the international monetary fund and and there's really very strong feeling uh among the world leaders around the u.n about the oecd world economic forum that there needs to be a new digital uh bretton woods to be able to set up governance for all this patchwork of crazy data systems because they're now central to governments responding to being able to know what to do to tax to investment and there's no coherence to them yeah and and the eu's already ahead of us this is already moving towards that okay thank you yeah well okay so in my own time we'll give the last question mr chef malik um please keep it to one the one most important question you might pose yeah no thank you professor penton for that um so i'm from streamr and we also built some open source software called data unions so it's a dedicated framework so people can do this stuff generically um so just a quick question would be this on that topic of of law um do you think that the single silver bullet could be something like uh sort of redefining portability rules um so they're in real time and they become single click rights so people can just take their data from existing platforms like spotify or netflix or whatever and just stick it into a data union collective yeah so so um a lot of existing law like in california and in europe actually has that as something that's required but it turns out it doesn't work partly at all what you need there is sort of uh both legal and political pressure so we're working with uh some of the big alliances um to set up legal challenges to enable that right uh under these existing laws and then the other thing is this political thing you need to be able to say you know lots and lots of people citizens people who vote pay taxes really want to have this happen and and then guess what they might actually listen right so so those two prongs are are the ways to do it i don't think many of these things are not purely technical problems they're they're have to do with politics and socio systems and stuff like that thank you so much for responding that's a very very interesting and stimulating um sort of q a which we have uh a lot more time um but um before we sign off i just want to do a quick intro for the people that are uh nothing with the asian financial society it's been a professional organization based off of uh people working on wall street and we do a lot of educational events we just finished a whole summer series of training for people um joining uh in the early careers uh in the financial uh world and um last week we just had a commercial real estate uh panel discussion and um uh also we run a um fintech competition called the alpha award that uh introducing startup to um possible uh venture capitalists or or other potential corporate investors uh to help them develop their own new venture so i put in the some of the website information the in the chat box so feel free to use that and take a look to keep track of our future programming and so forth um and next let me turn it back over to um jason uh who will uh highlight thanks arnold and thanks for organizing this uh so this was this event was co-co-sponsored by the mit club of new york and the asian financial society in in i'm sorry mit club of northern california and then afs out there in new york and uh arnold who's also an mit cnc member even though he lives out of state so uh just one want to kind of get our reach out there like we're here to bring the the community together uh share ideas so uh thanks again for organizing a great event arnold and professor pentland appreciate you coming out here and uh hopefully everybody you guys will uh keep checking out more of our events um and thanks for your time today thank you for more thank you thank you so much
