exciting to see everyone my name is Albert Chan a member of the MIT Alumni Club we organized some of these events for our communities so it's really great to see all of you here despite the fears of power outer power outages you guys still made it or maybe because you're trying to figure out batteries so maybe that's why you're here either way it's good to see you or sold out as you can see so I think we're gonna have a phenomenal speaker and we're in for a real treat just a few housekeeping items if you didn't see the restrooms are to the back to your right and so if you need that that's where they are second thing is the agenda today is fairly simple we have about an hour presentation from our speaker and that'll be followed by about 30 minutes of Q&A we'll start with a few questions that you submitted online and then we'll open it up to two audience questions here the third thing of housekeeping was for people who haven't been here to park before I just want to let you know that they are a research company around innovation and they are especially relevant to us they've been great partners to the MIT Alumni Club and they do things like incubate startups they do research in a specific areas contract researching and they also hire top-notch researchers so that might be interesting to some of you so check them out if that's relevant to you so now to the main event for many of you an MIT community professor yet Ming Chang needs no introduction but I'll give a few words in case you wanted a refresher he is an emic MIT person through and through I think if if he bled he would bleed beaver if that's possible he completed his bachelor's at MIT and then his doctorate at MIT and right at right after that he became a professor in the material science department and so he's been at MIT for 43 years yep so let's give a little round of applause just for that [Applause] because of that dedication he he decided to marry someone who was also an MIT alum his sister is an MIT alum and her and brother-in-law's an MIT alum and so he had it goes back deep here in case you were wondering you probably already know this but his research focuses on advanced materials and he's one of the premier experts in the world on energy storage he serves on numerous government and academic advisory committees and especially interesting to some of you and me as well he is a co-founder of numerous companies many of which are storage companies including a 1-2-3 24m and most recently form energy so with that list sake of Professor Chang a warm welcome [Applause] all right my on terrific all right what Albert didn't mention is that three times my life I tried to move to California I never made it right the first time I ended up going to MIT instead of to California when I finished my undergraduate degree I applied to all the California graduate schools and my thesis adviser got me hooked on a new project at that time which made me stay when I finished my PhD as I was approaching the end I thought I would come you know move to California and might they offer me a job and so once again I was stymied okay so these days I you know I'm in the Bay Area roughly twice a month though so I'm getting my the California in my taste of California at vicariously so I'm going to talk about energy storage and this is a this is a little bit of a over the top title you know I don't know the future of energy storages but I'm gonna tell you about some things that we're doing that are interesting to me and just to the disclaimer is that it's going to be mostly from the point of view of a material scientist okay and so what that means is that in each of these cases I've then I'll talk about try to find a rather narrow specific problem that if we can solve has a lot of leverage over a larger problem and so that'll be the nature of what I talk about all these logos down at the bottom are folks that I have gotten great intellectual stimulation from all right and a few of them I've even gotten money from as well okay okay but the more important part is the intellectual stimulation okay okay so before I start I want to actually give you the you know the report from MIT MIT is doing fabulously well I don't know when the last time you were there was I think we have some recent some challenges as you all have been reading about and I think we'll get through those but you know the brand name of MIT has never been better than it is after and I've been in there 43 years and so I wanted to begin not talking about stories just yet but to tell you about a recent study that was done a few years ago on innovation at MIT that led to some of the new things that are happening now such as you the engine you've all heard about but I was on a committee Committee on innovation entrepreneurship and Vladimir Bulova who some of you may know professor of electro engineering is responsible for the status I want to give him credit for it and so I'm going to assume everybody in this room you know knows the MIT campus intimately [Laughter] there's the MIT campus right so now if you go through the MIT campus and you know look for you know hallmarks of innovation patents are an imperfect measure everybody will agree right and especially you see they asked us at the bottom you know computer science not well represented by patents innovation in that area but it's something you can measure and so this is the density of patents on across the MIT campus I would not be showing you this if it weren't for the fact they're building 13 my building is the highest bar yeah okay there's some interesting data here so look out there at building e 25 that's the third highest bar e 25 is one individual Bob Langer the rest of us have to you know work together hey Bob does it all by himself so you know one of the reasons for this study was the question you know what is it that on the MIT campus that creates innovation so next chart I'll show you is by department okay and the horizontal axis is the number of inventors number of patents okay and then patents per inventor is a green bar and so if you look at the longest green bar there you're gonna say physics physics okay and so who here's from from course a thank you okay so that's an outlier for the following reason there's one faculty member who patents that are very very high rate that's John Chow innopolis right so again individual that dominates the department we had Bob Langer dominating entire building and we have John to innopolis yeah dominating your department but after John then there's patrol science and engineering so yeah we're proud of that metric and so one of the things that characterizes the most inventive places on the MIT campus is the the extent to which you collaborate right so this is not this is not new many of you probably know that such relationships exist but if you look at the number of inventors for patent versus number of patents it's not the peak at one so this concept of the lonely sole inventor really isn't true right it's when people work together that they invent and so this is the MIT faculty right and the patents issued MIT faculty but if you just take the two buildings thirteen and three and you see the messages that we collaborate more right that's the reason that's you know at least a correlation there okay all right and now so there's buildings 13 3 then there's course 3 and just to give you a snapshot of material science and engineering this is 1987 to roughly 2017 and so I don't honestly know the statistics for the department's but this gives you a snapshot so our department has founded 46 companies between 1987 to 2017 and now as of 2019 is probably right around 50 and so this we're proud of this of course three is proud of this and we think it's it's a measure of our impact and so the MIT it takes innovation very seriously and more so than certainly when I was an undergraduate or graduate student and the old what you will you hear about now and we'll continue her about are the things that are being done around MIT the engine is a new incubator but the difference is that the engine is also a venture fund all right so they don't just give you space to actually give you funds as well and that recently announced a tenfold expansion in footprint right very close to MIT right so ok on to on to the main topic right so I work on problems related to energy and environment that I think that material science can play a role in and the the fact that I ended up in this area it was somewhat of a surprise because when I was you know learning the field of material science and engineering that was not that was not the ambition but this has been a really a great area in which to you know to practice my field and to feel that you know we are making headway against the big problems that we have and so this is a slider a chart I borrowed from breakthrough energy ventures and you see the large parts of this pie here and so transportation so electric vehicle batteries and there's some day aircraft batteries we work in that area and I'll tell you a little bit about that electricity you know electrical storage for the grid right that's a secondary or so I'm gonna talk about it in that order their batteries for transportation batteries for the grid and then you look at two other very large pieces of the pie here okay we've actually started to work on this part called industry okay so I'm gonna at towards the end tell you a bit about a new project on cement and so it turns out cement you know don't laugh cement is a fascinating material okay that great stuff that we all use so much of and the part I haven't figured out how to tackle is the the the one in the lower right there agriculture and forestry right so I do that at a personal level that's you know our backyard we raise chickens and these and so what you're seeing there is you know a highly engineered what is called the chicken tractor designed by me my wife also PhD from MIT and a friend of our Scott Gattuso also a PhD and so this is a very highly design tractor engineered to be moved to so that it can be moved by a ten-year-old girl so they can help with the chores and so it's a totally open source design and VP if you want it okay alright so I haven't forgot what professionally to have impact on that but in those chicken tractors we raised the most expensive chickens in the state of Massachusetts okay okay on to batteries the batteries the first thing I want to say about batteries is that batteries are chemical devices they're electrochemical devices and so we're bound by the periodic table and what's been true for a long time continues to be true today is that we look for high energy density batteries to come from the top of the periodic table light elements right those the ones that will give us a high energy density per unit mass they're also higher density unit volume but more importantly per mass I think that it's going to be YouTube I think the reason okay yeah but so these are these are the common elements and frankly the problem is that the periodic table is just this in big enough you know we don't have enough elements to work with right and so if they're real extent we are actually constrained by what we can work with here and in particular you know we speak of a working ion the ion that does the there goes back and forth and is the the ion that stores charge and we really only have that short list over there and really is the top three yeah so that's really all we have to work with and lithium contain it continues to be in from the point of view of energy density the the preferred ion for us right we just simply can store more energy per mass or per volume when you use lithium today than any of the others so the taking this in mind I'm now going to say a little bit about batteries for transportation and where that's where that is and where that's headed and I'm gonna do so with a couple of plots like this that are intended to make two points first you know you know I actually I'm gonna skip over the part of you know what is a battery okay so we all understand that everyone says that batteries are have two electrodes and we store charge in the form of ions in both electrodes and in rechargeable battery has to go back and forth so that's what we look for and so each one on the left hand side here oh I'm gonna have to pause here and tell you that I was given the following guidance in preparing for this talk they said that this is a crowd that really wants to relive its MIT roots of drinking from the fire hose and that if I don't you know meet that bar the talk will be a complete failure so you can tell me out there at the end if I've succeeded so this is the theoretical energy density the main points that these are all very high and so can ask well how high is high this is kilowatt hours of energy per kilogram of material store and you see that you know there's all these there's a whole bunch of alphabet soup acronyms here and they all refer to specific chemistry's of compounds use there's electrodes and batteries so lithium is pretty straightforward gr is graphite now what's n MC 333 that's nickel manganese cobalt and make sure of that an oxide based on that the three three three is the ratio of the three there's something called L M RN MC and I have to try to remember what that means it actually means lithium and manganese rich n MC but these are all names for compounds and that's that that really isn't the important part but what you see is that you know on this theoretical energy plot the four to the left or what we're working towards in the themed ion batteries today that's what we use then you have to far out to the right and theoretically the energy density is fairly enormous this is let's say 3000 watt hours per kilogram and the the Tesla Model S pack right now is close to about 150 watt hours per kilogram it's a three thousand to 150 and so there's a there's really large gap between theoretically what chemistry can do and practically what we get out of it and there are a lot of reasons for that and so but what I want to do with this middle plot here is to show you if that's where we are today the open bubble down there where do we think we're going and the main point here is that in the lithium ion world people are always asking is lithium ion and reaching the end of its roadmap there's still a long way to go right we can still imagine going to perhaps three times the energy density if we really put into play all of the materials innovations that we think we can write the horizontal axis is the what are per mass and the way this has worked is that well you know from a physics point of view of moving a car down the road you know watt-hours amount of energy per mass makes a whole lot of sense but once you start designing a car you realize that the watt hours per volume actually more important we'd like to have a room for passengers for example luggage right and so the industry today actually values the vertical access more but what's happening is that with electric flight we're gonna I think we'll be back throughout value the horizontal access more so these are the kinds of things that we think about and so the of the middle is lithium-ion and then the right is a you know one alternative chemistry I'll just tell you try to illustrate why something like this might have higher energy density than lithium-ion but the the main thing is that actually to keep in mind where the top of this is two points when is that the top of the these charts are right around 500 watt hours per liter okay and the horizontal axis well it's around the maybe 350 400 watt hours per kilogram right I'll come back to those numbers later for instance when we talk about electric flight okay lithium sulfur you know we think of lithium-ion batteries such as we would use in our we still use in our cell phones we you still use lithium cobalt oxide as the primary compound the area under this curve which is voltage versus capacity which is amount of charge per mass milliamp hours programs the equivalent to coulombs per gram amount of charging store per mass the area under the curve is the amount of energy stores in terms of watt hours per mass and you see that the lithium sulfur of battery has five times that of a lithium ion battery why don't we all use lithium sulfur batteries okay so it turns out that we've we've been trying for about thirty or forty years to advanced lithium sulfur batteries to where it can take advantage something like this okay looks great right why wouldn't you do this and so just to point out one really practical issue it turns out that in order to make that lithium sulfur battery work we use a liquid electrolyte and every time we charge the liquid electrolyte part of that liquid electrolyte drives out and becomes a solid and we cycle it until it's dry and when it's dry it dies and unfortunately it takes a very few number of cycles for that to take place and so it turns out that how do you make a living cell for battery lasts a long time you give it a giant tank of electrolyte okay and you cycle and keep you know eating up that electrolyte and so that's not practical and that's one of the reasons the things sulfur isn't where it is theoretically okay not even close so those are kind of issues that we deal with when we try to design better batteries the other thing I want to point out here is that the top of both charts involves lithium metal okay and the lithium ion battery is famous because it does not use the theme metal it uses graphite that stores the lithium ions but it does not actually have the metal in it intentionally if you produced a lot of the metal then you actually are causing trouble okay so but what were the reason these roadmaps and with lithium metal is because today across the field that's where our focus is once again trying to make lithium metal they're successful and now and I'll tell you why it hasn't been so far but first if we look at what the US Department of Energy has funded for transportation batteries this is the vehicle technologies office they've grouped they're loosely speaking into what is lithium-ion today's technology that does not use it with your metal and then what you see is that on the right they have a category called beyond lithium-ion there are seven technologies here there's the seven shots on goal that they've been funding yeah Stanford MIT all across the country many many universities and National Labs and what you notice is that out of those seven six of them involved with your metal right and one of them does not involves a different metal magnesium metal and so the reason that there's the using lithium metal is so important from the energy density point of view is that you can't do any better than having your working ion precipitate in form of solid when it comes to the electric right you get rid of all the hosts that otherwise have to store that that lithium-ion and so you see that those are those are the the ones that we focus on and not only for energy density this is actually a cost plot because the vertical axis is cost and getting below a bar here of a hundred watt hours per kilograms per kilowatt hour it's a long-standing goal of the do e so they see that these are the chemistry's that can do it some of you saw this just yesterday right so the Nobel Prize was given to three individuals John Goodenough Stan Winningham and akhirat Yoshino and the reason I show you this the first you know it's great that finally lithium-ion technology is recognized right and you might ask how has a why has it taken so long we think it's taking a very long time and in part it's because I think because the advances took place important contributions by different individuals over literally 30 years okay and so no one of them created a fully successful battery okay and so that probably is one of the reasons why it's taken a long time to reach this level of recognition John Goodenough is now 97 years old is the oldest recipient of the Nobel Prize ever and so stea Winningham is now what Stan did back in the very early 70s at Exxon New Jersey was that he created a battery much like what I showed earlier which is a lithium metal electrode against a cathode which at that time was typing disulfide so that battery demonstrated that you could use lithium and secondly that you could use a compound called that in circulation compound as the cathode but what didn't work was that the lithium metal electrode it did not actually function well for long enough and safely enough Exxon did not commercialize that technology the company that did called Mali energy essentially went out of business because they were the first market with a battery that uses lithium metal and the problem with lithium metal was that it formed something called a dendrite which had the this unfortunate behavior causing an internal short circuit which combined with a flammable liquid solvent you know and the the expected that happen so there's this great you know this example of the first to market gets crushed and so the innovation that is the lithium ion battery was actually would stand demonstrated but without the with or without the lithium metal and so yoshino-san his you know a contribution to this was recognizing that carbon right was a an ideal host to insert that lithium into so that you didn't actually get the metal itself you know so the so a battery or lithium metal battery is an electroplating machine every time we charge and discharge it we plate lithium metal and so what he did was to show that you could use graphite and not actually get the metal so the irony of all this is that what Sam Whittingham did Randa this obvious barrier with lithium metal in the interim the theum ion was created John Goodenough contribution amongst many was to come up with that lithium cobalt oxide that I showed you earlier but here in 2019 we're back to lithium metal again okay so I wrote my first research proposal asking India we for funding to work on our lithium on the little metal electrode back in the fall of 2016 and so many of you remember what was going on in the fall of 2016 and so I asked my program manager you know if I title this proposal let's make lithium metal great again help me get funded so that's when I got back to this game Hey okay all right okay so there how do you make lithium metal so I hope you know I made the case I've been trying to make the case that lithium metal is where the near in the next 10 years for folks like us we want to see lithium metal in real commercialized battery a rechargeable battery and so what of the way is there a number of ways to do this that you can do with the liquid electrolyte you can do with a you know clever design clever architecture you can coat the lithium metal you there are a lot of different approaches that are being tried by you know a lot of researchers but one of the general areas that's gotten a lot of attention is to make the battery all solid-state now we like solid-state electronic devices why do we have batteries that use liquid electrolytes why don't we all just use solid-state batteries that would make life so much easier right and so you see these news clippings and so over the last few years there's been a lot of focus on solid-state electrolytes and in particular in conjunction with lithium metal so what are solid-state electrolytes these are ceramic compounds that happened to be able to transport lithium ions at a fairly high rate and over the last decade what was discovered or some new ceramic compounds in which the conductivity of those lithium ions was just as high as it is in a liquid electrolyte you have a solid that conducts lithium and justice passes liquor electrolyte solids have an advantage at low temperature liquid electrolytes often freeze and then when they freeze the conductivity drops our solid electrolytes they're already frozen right it's not gonna happen again okay okay so that's why at low temperature you see the green curved nose dives downward that's a liquid electrolyte and the the solid state it just continues hey so and the problem was so it was perceived that we might be able to solve this lithium dendrite problem with the using a solid because if you have a hard solid lithium metal yeah I don't know if any of you have ever actually handled lithium metal right so first of all it's very low density it's you know half a gram per CC is half the density of water you throw it on water it floats and then it blows up the first it floats then it blows up right okay but the other thing about lithium metal is that this it's it's like taffy you know it is very soft and this idea that a soft electro is a soft metal against a hard ceramic electrode we'll be a very stable construction that's the that was the idea and they hope right I'm gonna show you that that turns out not to be true right and so that's that's where we're at today so first of all just if you look at the volumes of each of these three pictures in the middle let's call that commercial lithium ion whenever someone tells me about a new solid-state battery the first question I asked and the first question you should ask is did it enable a metal electrode because if it didn't you don't actually gain any energy density that's what time - right and you almost certainly have a batteries that cost you more okay you really have to use that metal so you can shrink the whole volume and master the whole device okay so that's that's the first thing so just because the solid-state battery you're not going to gain unless you enable the metal and so here's the big surprise lithium metal actually when you deposit it penetrates these hard ceramic electrolytes like when they have the hardness of window glass very easily and so you know what's going on here this is our big surprise in looking at this and what analogy to it is you know water is is fluid but you know that the freeze-thaw cycle of water is extremely damaging right and so we can think of what happens to these ceramic electrolytes as being analogous to that the only difference is that we're electro depositing this metal but it is despite its softness is able to generate great pressure that actually fractures hard ceramics and so here's a couple of examples in each case what we're doing is we're the the lithium you can't see the ions but they're coming through the solid and it's plating lithium metal and what you see is that you have this metal that's growing into the solid that's what these pictures are showing you and so even when you take the most perfect single crispness of what's the most perfect solid electrolyte you can imagine let's get a single crystal very expensive never and so we go grow single crystal we polish it it's the most perfect solid looks like you can imagine and that's that single crystal sitting right there and then we take it and make a cell and we electrically drive lithium back and forth through it and we plate lithium and the top surface and but we still here to see if I can get this let's play okay well maybe I need to do that nope all right you're gonna have to use your imagination okay so if we're working where you would see so in this case with the positing lithium metal from the bottom up towards the top with it says gold electrode and what this video will show you is that you see lithium metal growing up through this single crystal and eventually at the bottom you see the electrical short occur okay okay so why does it do this so it turns out that these surfaces of solemn electrolytes where the lithium metal meets this solid it's always defective to some extent okay so if you think of it as having flaws I can show you here this is very much like how brittle materials fail they fail because of the surface flaws not the bulk properties so you have surface flaws that are the initiators the sites that were defects propagate from and what happens in this electroplating process is that we first fill those surface flaws and then what you have is a metal asperity which to all the electrical engineers in the audience will look a lot like a field emitter and so we are depositing a lithium metal at a asperity that's like a field emitter and so that's where the metal deposits first when you consider the what can you know what has to happen here as you deposit this metal is that you have to have there has to be a volume expansion to accommodate the metal and so that metal can either open the crack and dry and allow the dendrite to go forward or it has to be extruded you know or forced out the backside of the crack right so in this picture up top here the metal you know what's gonna happen is that the metal is deposited with that red arrow is and either it has enough time and low enough let's call it viscosity so that it can flow out or it's going to open the crack and so and then that's all that behaviors or compounded by the fact that any time you have an in this you have this cotton ooh in a metal electrode you also get a field concentration right so these two effects combined are really what prevents these the this these lithium solid-state lithium metal based batteries from working today so we we are making some progress on this and so you know what is it to someone like you know folks like us you know what is the you know what is the what is what is success it turns out that because of the phenomenon I just showed you there's only a limited current density that we can run through these batteries before the metal dendrite forms and causes internal short-circuit today that current density is too low on the vertical axis here these are units of milliamps per centimeter squared this is the current through the battery current essentially through the battery and it turns out that for a range of solid electrolytes all below one a practical battery has to be at least three and so we have figured out a approach to getting around this problem which is the mysterious recent MIT result okay now we have a few more experiments to do but if this is successful then you'll read about it and I think that this will be a significant step towards actually enabling a solid-state lithium metal based battery okay so this is this is how I get my kicks as a material scientist goddess all right I'm gonna have to really move here okay let's talk about electric flight we're interested in electric transportation in all its forms and so there's a lot going on in electric aviation today right and so based I'll take take what I just talked about and say you know you can ask the question what is required going from electric vehicles today to electric airplanes I have a colleague at Carnegie Mellon University and venkat Viswanatha and so he's he knows actually much more about batteries and electric flight than I do so I'm gonna crib a couple of his slides okay so but you know he's really done a deep dive on this thing I showed a couple of things that yeah and so this is a venkat recent paper from last year it turns out that the most kind of out-of-the-box type of vehicle which is the you know vertical takeoff and landing electric vehicle which is a lot like a drum is actually from the point of view of the battery the the the closest okay so it turns out that this so if you take this you know here here a couple of military versions but if you imagine you know like uber elevate there's something a passenger a vehicle that takes off cruises and lands it turns out that's the most challenging parts of that flight cycle are the two green parts the steep parts of the beginning the end the vertical axis is the power that you need okay so that's where the power the battery has to discharge at a very high rate and if you look at the time axis it has to discharge that they're very high rate for much longer than any reasonable person can stand on the accelerator of a car okay you just don't stand on the gas for that long hey but when you find this vehicle you do so it turns out that taking off and then landing landing is just as strenuous on the battery is taking off so in the middle the power you need for cruise is relatively modest and then there's this other part that we have to keep in mind is that in order to fly you have to have a very significant reserve power or reserve energy left that's the green part right so if you look at that and this is the flight cycle for a VTOL look there's the viitala vertical takeoff and landing cruise and all right and that's the landing part okay that green part is what I just showed you right and then on the bottom here that flight cycle is compared to a couple of other at what we will call you know fairly challenging applications today electric vehicle electric semi-truck ok and what you see is that the takeoff and landings where the power who has to exceed what you see in the in the ground vehicles right so for us it boils down to a fairly straightforward problem we have to learn how to deliver high energy density but also high discharge power for long durations compared to long durations and so how far away is it this is a plot that you know my friend Venkat compiled and each one of those thoughts represents a commercial lithium ion battery today the horizontal axis is the specific energy white hours per kilogram what's in the circle there is the requirement for to get started the minimum requirement for a VTOL and honestly we look at that and say that that isn't that hard we should be able to do that with some you know continued work okay and so that's you know another 10% increase in specific energy over the best we can do today but it is three times the power okay so and so we have to figure out how to get the lithium ion out of the electrodes and across that battery faster than we can today while still maintain that energy density this is Venkat himself we have a project just started funded by our flight sciences which is looking at different ways of doing that and one of the ways of doing that is to create battery electrodes with an internal structure that's really designed for transport with high with essentially lanes high-speed lanes for lithium ions so that's what that's what electric flight for vetos here's electric flight for the rest of the airplane food this is a paper that is not yet out but what you see here is across a number of vehicle types of flight cycles a regional jet requires a specific energy here of about 650 watt hours per kilogram okay narrow-body wide-body and person were over a thousand watt hours per kilogram right this is the most ambitious electric vehicle battery project in in the u.s. today battery 500 funded by a u.s. department energy numerous National Labs what you see here is that this is considered an ambitious project project for electric vehicles and it just barely gets to what we can do with a confessional airplane okay so this is the gap that we're facing you so people ask me hey can you fly across the you know do intercontinental flight with a wide-body you're playing well you need about 12 12 under Y dollars per kilogram and this is where you say you know batteries cannot solve all of society's problems yeah just the most important ones okay okay so okay how's my time right okay I'm concerned half now oh okay good all right I'm now going to switch over to the grid the other area and talk about batteries for electrical electrical storage for our electricity system and I borrowed this slide from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the little circle there is what batteries are in the context of the energy ecosystem today right the storage is actually much larger and for that's all pumped hydro electric storage that's over 95% of the storage we have today batteries a tiny little bit so but if we look at what's going on in electricity generation this all public data from the EIA 2002 roughly today what we see is that you know coal is declining coal is on its way out we're gonna help give it a little shove but it's you know it's going there you know with or without us right and there's only two curves here that are increasing and positive slope one is natural gas in there there's renewables and natural gases a factor of five above renewables here okay you can look at this slide as you see here you can come to the conclusion that natural gas wins unless we come up with breakthrough storage that enable allows renewables to beat natural gas so this is at least one way to simplify the problem you know I like this one because allowed us to think about the problem is simple way meet natural gas like beat La Vie natural gas hey so no with that kind of party this allows us to then look at the problem and say you know what what would it really take so it's been you know a few months trying to you know elaborate on what a breakthrough in energy storage should actually look like what is it that we need if you look at lithium-ion decreasing in price so dramatically over the last decade or so and you look at how this how batteries are being deployed and utility scale project so this on the right is no year by year and is only utility storage and what you see is that the blue bar it's bigger and bigger right so it would appear as if it's all lithium-ion okay and so the question is you know again a common question can we do it all we lit the Imai on a lot of pieces to that question the wood lithium-ion really excels at is storage up to a few hours and so you know the one Ducker problem is a few hours of storage and so this you know really I believe that this can be this can be satisfied with lithium I especially as the cost continues to come down and so this is a laurel mountain you see lithium on Berry Farm at the time in 2011 was the largest lithium ion battery farm in the world has used a 23 batteries and it was to accomplish this kind of ramping for the windmills that you see in the back right so but if you if all we have is you know 100% predictable you know daily the diurnal solar cycle no cloudy days you know then this could be all we ever need right but you know it turns out that the world is more complicated than that here's a sure you'll recognize and so how do we look at how how what kind of storage we need and so this is you know Albert said you know use data okay right I'm gonna show you how we think about this problem this so what is this plot the vertical axis on a log scale is how much the battery cost us the horizontal axis is how often we use the battery okay the Daiya the diagonal lines here is the cost of electricity delivered from that storage system as if you were just getting electricity through your meter okay so the bottom is two cents a kilowatt hour okay and so what those lines show you is that if you pay a certain price for a battery and then you use it a certain number times a year and it lasted 20 years right that then determines the utilization of the battery and how much that electricity cost you okay all right so this is one way to look at how much a battery has the cost in a certain application okay okay let's see this horizontal axis is a great oversimplification because we don't actually use batteries simply by charging discharging them their duty cycles are actually very complex so if we then map on to this that chart that I just showed you what matters we have today it can do the lithium-ion battery system that band at the top yeah the cost at grid scale I think is unlikely to get much below about $100 a kilowatt hour okay and then we have some other technologies that are coming along that are these other curves VFR B is a vanadium redox flow battery there's some futures some other chemistry's that are being designed for flow batteries and then also shown on this plot is where PHS pump hydroelectric storages there were a lot a lot of that in the world today compressed air that's underground and compressed air energy storage we don't have a lot of that in the world today but we can you know design it and what you see is that up to a certain cycling race certain you a utilization we have technologies that might work right but beyond so once we get through a few days and beyond weekly and beyond this case we really have a technology right and so that's that's where there is a gap and so then the question you know then the question people often ask is well do you really need longer duration storage so and how long a duration do you need and so do we need a technology there okay so we looked into that with a with an academic study that's now published for which there is also a commercial version which uses proprietary information that isn't published but what we did was to say if we take the current generation methods for electricity at the bottom here is baseload electricity just 24/7 continuous output of electricity yeah and then there's a what's called intermediate generation where it's in roughly four hour blocks or so and then there's something called peakers I think those but peakers are in the tournament and the typical operating cycle is about four hours now so the question would be if we looked at these kind of generation profiles and we used wind and solar as the source of electricity and we use storage as the way to smooth it out over those durations how does that all work out and what is it that we actually need so first of all the study that we did that's published uses the simplest possible wave form for the actual output of these power plants you know basically is not exactly flat right and peakers aren't exactly a square wave alright but that's how in this case we modeled it right and so we did the following this is a study that I did with a colleague at MIT Jessica transit this is the wind belt so I'll give you an illustration we looked at both wind and solar but you see in the middle of the US the the wind back there and so we can pick off a couple of places that have you know very good winds such as you know Iowa in this case and we can get the generation from that site from the last 20 years and we can make the assumption that the next 20 years look like the last 20 years and then we say let's say we have the ability to build walk more wind at a cost and to build storage attica and then we're going to look at the two and change the relative amounts of more generation you know over generation and storage and figure out what gives us the lowest cost electricity all in okay and so what is the what is the combination of generation storage that minimizes the LCOE levelized cost of electricity out of that combined system and we can do it with different price batteries and expensive a big cheap battery will use the battery more a small expensive battery will will have more generation okay okay so the results look something like this the color coding that you see here is the levelized cost of electricity and so that down to the bottom this five cents a kilowatt hour I don't know what actually is here in the Bay Area but you know for us it's around but right now you don't get anyway so you in there England's about ten cents to ten twelve cents a kilowatt hour okay so so the first thing is that this combination of renewable generation in this case wind and batteries we want to be in the blue in the dark of the blue the better yeah there we're competing with natural gas beat natural gas okay as it goes towards the red that's now very expensive the horizontal axis is how much the energy storage system costs us in terms of dollars per kilowatt hour the vertical axis is how much it costs us in terms of thousand per kilowatt power but you'll see that these are very steep so let's just ignore that it's not very sensitive to that the real question that we're trying to answer here is how cheap does the battery system have to be in order for wind plus storage to give us a levelized cost of electricity that Beach natural gas the simple answer is less than about thirty dollars a kilowatt hour right okay so less than about three dollars a kilowatt hour lithium ion we think the floor might be around a hundred and there's another factor feature here which is that the slopes correspond to how long you have to store that energy for kind of on average now and it says about 100 hours there's about four days right and so in this particular scenario four days of storage less thirty thousand kilowatt hour we don't have a solution for that today okay so trying to simplify you know there's endless complexity in this paper you can go read it one's a simple conclusion oops I missed that part three thousand kilowatt hour and how would you actually use this battery what's the battery actually do this chart is the state of charge of the battery at the top the battery is fully charged the bottom is fully depleted this is twenty years of operation of that battery and you can see that depending on whether it's solar wind or a mix of the two the qualitatively that the common features are that you build a very large very cheap battery to cover periods of deep loss in renewable generation they don't last very long they last you know a few days at a time but you you get nothing there in those periods and that's really what you designed the battery to do this is if you want to supply the kind of reliability of electricity that we're all used to in this case one hundred percent right the answer doesn't change very much for 99% 98% 50% the promise I the user saw but we're not happy with fifty percent reliability okay okay okay so this led us to the question of what could you what kind of battery can give you that kind of low cost at you know in that kind of long duration and coming back to the chemistry a plot this is the last 100 years of battery chemistry all in one plot the quarter by the year that it would you know came you know came into existence and the vertical plot is a log scale of the cost of the chemistry hey and so this is just the cost of the chemical so we haven't built the battery yet just to cost the chemicals okay and you notice that it's a band that moves upwards on a log plot over the last 100 years or at least last 50 and so the you know the right question for all of you to ask us what are you doing what are you and all your friends who are battery electro cameras doing so what we are doing is trying to give you high energy density for your electric vehicle okay that's the reason for this so what we and so this is where that when to basic electricity band was and so this is a filter nothing above it is going to work because the chemicals cost us too much and we haven't even built the battery yet and so well what are the what are the ones that fall below and well it turns out the sodium and sulfur tremendously abundant you know the elements in the Earth's crust and they also have a high energy density so you can you know the energy density the dollars per kilowatt hour of energy is high and so you know we tend to focus so you know you can do that used as a filter and this what we did I said okay what we want is sodium and sulfur but what we want is not a sodium sulfur battery of the type that youth has existed up until now which is a high temperature battery molten sodium molten sulfur okay we wanted ambient temperature battery and so that's the work that we did in this particular case this is Sam Liang and the the gang of three as I call them and so we came up with a battery that used a sulfur as an ultra-low cost ingredient and then the other electrode is the cheapest electrode we could find which is air okay so sulfur air and so that create this very low-cost combination this is what led to the founding of form energy this this work that caused us to realize that there might be a technical solution to this that picture I have to point out was taken Christmas Eve of 2016 okay 16 yo and these guys are in the lab getting data and we have this picture and so you know you know I could have had him over it's Christmas Eve I'm getting data but happily doing so and so this so the reason that this particular battery of electrochemistry was so interesting to us if you look at not only the cost but the abundance of sulfur on the right-hand side here this is Saudi Arabia the very gas plant and that giant yellow pile there's also fur that sulfur power alone is equivalent to 1.2 terawatt hours of battery storage the global sulfur resource is 25 terawatt hours of battery storage in this particular form and so that completely Dwarfs even pumped hydro today and so at least here's a one approach that would could conceivably get there so for Mataji is this country there is now 2 years old and we just raised the second round and so I want to just tell you you know who it is who do we rope together to work on this problem very low cost long duration storage with Matero Jaramillo who was at Tesla until the end of 2016 and he was director of drivetrains at one point and then later a head of Tesla energy and Ted Wylie he's our president and he started a kree on another battery company marco ferrara the guy over the on the right it says SBB SVP but his other title is cio which stands for chief italian officer and if you know marco you know exactly what i mean but what he does is something enormously valuable for us which is data analytics so I showed you an academic study you're figuring out you know what kind of battery to design for what kind of application so I want you to imagine the commercial version of doing this we get a actual power producer who for example has a coal plant that they're trying to phase out and the question might be given the wind that we have in that region and the wind the wind plant that's already there what kind of storage combined with that wind plant would allow you to replace that allow you to face out that coal plant right and so what you need to do that is that you need to know all the economics of that coal plant and you need to know exactly what is the output profile today so that's the kind of exercise that we go through that Marco leaves for us though the work for the young guy in the middle in the back there is an amazing young CTO and so this is this is how we're going after this problem if you read the article that just came out in technology review that mentions form today it says we were working on multiple chemistry's right and so I just want to say that you know sulfur is great and we're spending a lot of time on sulfur but there it turned out that that plot I showed you I actually missed a couple down on the low end and so there are a couple of others that we're looking at as well yeah it could be super low cost so okay let me just summarize this part and I want to spend a little bit it's just liver time and the other topic so I said you know the future of energy storage will you know what is one person's view future of energy storage now I think this metal the the metal electrode is going to will extend the lithium ion roadmap and so you know we will I believe we will have rechargeable batteries based on lithium metal within say five years or so right and they'll start in some relatively short life applications when it comes to electric aviation you know I think that we can at least allow those who are thinking about how to implement a VTOL to have some assurance that with continued work wouldn't give a battery that can get them quote off the ground right okay commercially literally to commercial air transport much more challenging okay we haven't read and you know there's others we haven't really thought about shipping yeah shipping is another big problem for the grid up to about ten hours you know if that's the space you're playing in I would be very concerned about whether lithium-ion is continued across town we'll be end up being forever the technology to be but for the longer duration applications there you know we haven't had technologies and that's where we can tap into some of these newer chemistry's so with that let me talk about a couple of other topics okay so the entire world isn't all batteries even for an electric cameras and I've been trying to get out of this battery field I can't but I started working out a couple of other things I wanted so go back to a pie chart I showed you the beginning I was talk about to to quote their recent topics one on the right is related to cement okay the one on the sorry that's the that's the left the one on the right there's one this is Google under it is a project in cold fusion okay right so I'm gonna talk about these in order and our project in cement is asking the question is there a way to use low-cost renewable electricity to produce cement right the way we do it today is primarily with called I have to credit Dave Danielson for inspiring me and pushing me to spend time on this problem over a couple of years these are the cast of characters who worked on it Leia is a postdoc on the the one shown on the left here is the I would call her the project leader who's really pushed this forward and is one somewhere she intends to continue taking us forward and I wanted to start with explaining this problem what is the problem we're trying to solve and give you three simple numbers the first is that each kilogram of cement that we produce releases one kilogram of co2 that's an easy calculation the second is that we produce four billion tons of cement per year and that's going to continue to increase and the third is its absurdly low selling price is what makes it so difficult to disrupt you have this absolutely giant industry with a absolutely commoditized product and that is by far the hardest thing to disrupt right but the need to disrupt it is in that co2 number right so we started thinking about this and so you know just a brief description of what is cement this is our new building though this is MIT Nano this is this beautiful limestone that they use and you know Vladimir bulla Vic one level should be ashamed of himself you got all this limestone from a quarry in southwest China giant carbon footprint right here comes in Cambridge Massachusetts but this is what we have in mind when we make cement is that this is limestone cement starts off as limestone and we turn it into cement and then over time it turns back into limestone okay okay that's that's the cement process the difference between concrete and cement concrete is the stuff with the gravel in it cement is the stuff that doesn't yet have the gravel in it so the great pace that you see that's the cement hey ordinary Portland cement and so the way we make it today is the start with limestone which is calcium carbonate and we turn it into lime and we cook off the co2 all right Chemical co2 that comes right off the calcium carbonate we mix it with clay clay minerals silica and we produce a calcium silicate and in doing this whole process you know it turns out that about half of the co2 we release comes from the calcium carbonate itself Cement the other half comes from the fuel that we use for the two parts of it right the first part cow signing the second part a higher temperature heat treatment okay so in order to really solve this problem you want to be able to attack all three of these we want to do something about this chemical co2 and do something about the fuel that we use the heating okay so the rate of which cement is being produced in the world is equivalent to one New York City every thirty days hey projected to continue for the next 40 years okay so giant problem so how are people attacking us today so it hasn't escaped the notice and I generally classify the approaches that are underway is either alternative cements in which you try to capture co2 in the cement itself trap more co2 that's taking a backwards ground state faster accelerating that for bringing back to his ground state and the other is capturing the co2 from the evolved from the flue gas that's what the Center one generates okay none of these approaches use electoral chemistry except for coal era which is up in the upper left their goal is also to make beneficial use of the co2 and put more co2 in the in the process and they do so through an electrochemical process so you know well we were what we wanted to do is to see can we make Portland cement instead of trying to give someone a new cement all right give them just the cement that there's used to can we do that and use low-cost removal electricity because of this this rising tide or very low cost electricity from a renewable generation and so it turns out that the method that we are focused on right now in chemical terms is really very simple and what this gift shows you is an electrolyzer they will probably probably almost everybody in this room built one of in-state high school right and you know out of the right side is hydrogen coming off and the left side is oxygen and what's been putting this this is just a neutral water solution with some salt in it but what is giving you the color is a pH indicator so when you built that electrolyzer in high school middle school they told you that hydrogen oxygen come off they probably didn't tell you that at the same time one side gets very acidic the other side gets very basic but that's what happens right and that's the part we're taking you want to take advantage of here so the pH scale is the bottom the right is very basic the right left is very acidic hey why is that useful I'm going to remind you of another experiment you did in middle school so which is that you took vinegar you put baking soda in it and it went boom and what came off with co2 right so sodium carbonate and also calcium carbonate one put in an acidic solution will release pure co2 okay so we have a reactor here now think of it as a reactor we have an electrolyzer hydrogen oxygen and so what happens here is that this side is the acidic side you see H+ protons being released that size the basic side o h minus left there's own devices that you just can recombine emit form water in the middle but we're going to keep them from doing that what we're going to do instead is to dribble in calcium carbonate on this side okay and it's going to dissolve it's going to release co2 just like your middle school chemistry experiment that co2 is now pure co2 mixed with pure oxygen those that mixture we can deal with is easy to separate this releases calcium at the solution and then from the right we have a highly basic solution and so calcium and Oh H together form calcium hydroxide that's a white precipitate so you imagine as this takes place imagine a snow globe and we're sitting out as calcium hydroxide so this is what's going on in this case and now there's calcium carbonate over here a very simple reactor on a bench top and so you see that the yellow part is the middle pH and so while that's taking place we're precipitating calcium hydroxide and it looks something like this white the pods that you see on the right yeah so on the left this calcium hydroxide is in it is a is a precursor to cement so instead of using calcium carbonate we now use the calcium hydroxide because when that decomposes it only releases water and so we produced calcium hydroxide here and it comes to know these different morphologies and we can do so with it turns out very high efficiency that you know in terms of every electron that we - the electrolyzer produces a certain amount of converted calcium carbonate okay and so this is what we call the coulombic efficiency of device and so if the overall reaction is we have calcium carbonate producing calcium hydroxide and releasing three gases you know we have co2 we have hydrogen the wave oxygen because intellectualized at the same time so what we've shown is that this material can now be used to make the active phase in ordinary Portland cement OPC when you hear ordinary Portland cement the O is capitalized it is not an adjective it's a name and so now there's an ordinary Portland cement is is there is the product and so we've got we've done the first step in in showing that this could be used in order to produce cement and so what's what's the whole idea here the idea is that if we have a electrolyzer based process for making cement we can power renewable electricity and we get off hydrogen and oxygen which is of course also a fuel and it turns out that that hydrogen oxygen if we were to simply combust it would provide enough thermal output to heat to complete the rest of the process so coincidentally turn just turns out that way so we're envisioning this is a long way this is you know this is this is it says a fission not yet reality not reality yes vision and so but the idea of using renewable EXA t2 now both supply the fuel and 2d carbonate the the limestone so this is our cement project last one all right cold fusion okay okay on May 27th 2019 nature published our article a perspective revisiting the cold case of cold fusion and there were not one not two but three editorials that have appeared in nature that same day different journalists and you know you know how those Brits are they like to show these pictures that look like you know and all movie TV show this is what fusion and cold fusion researchers look like in 1989 and they reprinted that that's the Martin Fleischmann and the woman is actually a US Congresswoman and at the bottom this is what cold fusion researchers look like today okay courtesy of Matt for everything Matt shot this photo and you know we had to put this out just to show this is the new face of cold fusion 30 years later okay all right so so what's going on here okay what's going on this was a project that was in stealth for three now four years so I just want to say you know what did Google do in this case so we couldn't no one in the United States I was just flat I'll say no no research the United States could write a government agency proposal to work on cold fusion and have any hope of getting it funded no hope of ever getting a through peer review right it took a different mechanism to make it safe to work on cold fusion again and that different mechanism was in this case Google support and so you you see what happened here is that you know none of us had any prior experience with cold fusion you saw the four groups that was shown there had substantial amount of funding over three years but it was always with the idea of publishing everything that came out at the right time in the right time was this past this right to explain to divulge what it is that we're doing and so now if you read that article you know that it says that we have not found convinced convincing evidence we have not found not just a convincing we have not found evidence for cold fusion yet okay okay but we believe it's something that's worth looking into and so I'm telling you a story that does not yet have an ending here because this is something that we're still doing and but what I wanted to show you is you know what is that you do so how do how do you how do you actually work on cold fusion and let's say that you think cold fusion is a possibility how do you work on it what do you right so in my case it was actually you know boiled down to a relatively simple materials problem and which is why it was something that you know we felt we could make some progress with and it has to do with getting a very high concentration of hydrogen in palladium so that there's the opportunity for cold fusion should it be favourable right and you know the the theoretical basis that would tell us exactly what we need to achieve in terms of hydrogen concentration and and in local structure is not yet known right but all the evidence from prior work suggests that you at least have to get to very high hydrogen concentration and this is where the electrochemistry comes in okay so it turns out that electrochemically whoops I think I missed this thing I lost the slide here somewhere okay I lost one slide that's okay so palladium is in the middle and what we do is that we electro chemically Drive hydrogen into palladium it turns out that's the beauty of electrochemistry is that with the turn of a knob and fractions of a volt you can apply a chemical potential a thermodynamic driving force that's equivalent to many many giga pascals of applied pressure and so that's why we use electrochemistry if we were we would have to build this giant pressure apparatus to do the same thing they were can do just by 100 millivolts or so the problem so we turned out that we can do that but the problem is that hydrogen leaks out of play em just as fast as you put it in okay so that turns out there that that's that's why you can't get this stuff loaded to a very high state and so we have this problem with electro chemically pumping and hydrogen easy-easy leaking out very quickly okay and so how do you stop the leak that essentially turns out to be the problem and so we built all this fancy instrumentation to figure out how to pump it in and how to figure out how fast it's coming out all right so that's what all this represents I won't go into detail but what you see down here these sandwiches in the middle DNF these are these electrochemical cells in which we had one a lot driving in hydrogen into the into the material and in the middle is or the sample the sample section at the top is plating so what we found is that well we always figured out why the bucket is so leaky it turns out that palladium when you insert hydrogen into it expands tremendously then it's a mechanical problem electro chemically we cause fracture and the surface what you see on the left here this is the on a piece of electrolyte is the thin film of palladium and you see all these eruptions and locally we're creating very high equivalent pressures and it's actually blowing the material apart and so this this is the problem that we have to solve in order to try to maximize the amount of hydrogen get into palladium and so what we found is the best way to do it is to make the underlying substrate as soft as possible okay and it turned out that so this plot is showing you the vertical axis is how much hydrogen we got in one is at the top is saturated the horizontal axis is the voltage that we apply to the device increasing as you go to the left the lines there or the theoretical for the thermodynamic values that we would get and so what we see here is in every case we don't reach that line because the bucket is leaking okay but where we shows that we can get very close to the saturated value 0.96 and you know we were able to actually do this at a very high precision okay so this was a small step on the way to really being able to evaluate to be able to study cold fusion first you have to be able to reliably make the materials in which you do this and beyond this there's a second step which is to now take this palladium lattice and to jam even more hydrogen into it and so all of you of the MIT alums here probably took either three or nine one or five 41 and so you all remember the in 309 one you learn all about the rock style crystal structure okay turns out that that's palladium hydride it's the rock salt the compound palladium hydrogen and that's what you see in the grade read there so it turns out that there's another phase at analyzing phase in which the the hydro deuterium would be even closer together and that's the one that we're really interested in looking for cold fusion in and so our goal is boiled down if so my group our participation is boiled down to trying to make unusual states of palladium hydride in order to study the like the possibility of cold fusion hey and if we do that a reference experiment what happens to the materials that we make they go into this apparatus which is that Lawrence Berkeley labs Thomas wrinkles benchtop fusion apparatus you know may surprise you that you can produce you know fusion at will deuterium deuterium fusion at will on a bench top and in a lead-lined room but really very simply okay and so this is the device into which were intended put these and jewelled materials and if we see some exciting something exciting you know you'll read about it alright I am probably over time I'm gonna stop there and so thank you for your attention that's be happy to take some questions [Applause] so fire firehose indeed I might take a nap after this but I promised some time for questions so I'm gonna open it up with two quick questions that were submitted online and then we're gonna have two runners with some of the questions you might have here so I'm just gonna break it down to two of the top questions one in business and one in technology just to summarize from a technology perspective I think you covered a lot about the chemical batteries but you didn't talk as much around like hydrogen generation ammonia generation do you have a sense for if they will play a good role in this yeah so I think that you know there are there are a lot of technologies I didn't talk about and the fact they're probably people in this audience who are practicing practicing technologies that I didn't talk about so you know I you know I my general views the first large journal view is that you know all of the above you should really you know look at all of them the reason electrochemistry is interesting to me is because it's even a lousy battery has much much higher energy density than for instance you know pump water pumped rocks mechanical energy density so that's one of the reasons that but just specific questions about hydrogen right yeah and so when we won that one of my plus actually did have hydrogen in it right and so it's the cost of producing that hydrogen right and then there of course is the storage of hydrogen so hydrogen can hydrogen the effective storage medium for long duration storage technically I think absolutely it can't it really comes down to the economic stuff of how you would do it you have to be able to store it on the ground and then you have to be able to produce it at a cost I think the I think fortune that slide below a dollar and a half a kilogram okay so but you know low-cost renewable electricity is also you know stirring up a lot of new activity and electrolysis yeah great great and then from a business perspective several people noted your experience with startups and so the question is what kind of costs are performance improvements is needed now to track VC interest or just to be relevant you should ask the VC yeah yeah I think the the the main point that I would make is that the I I do believe there's a gap between where we can get with lithium aya and I love lithium-ion it starts to companies making lithium-ion batteries the you know at some point the the the the the mineral prices really are going to be the floor on those costs yeah and you know we see some studies with learning curves and we actually published a paper last year which is modifying learning curves because you know minerals often are you know slow learners okay so so you have to if you're going to use a learning curve argument you have to actually separate it and put a learning curve and apply learning curves or for instance the development of the manufacturing technology we have to have a different curve for the price of minerals okay and so if you do that that puts a floor on what lithium-ion battery costs can be and you know I it wouldn't surprise me if as long as we stick to cobalt nickel the transition metals that we currently are focused on for high energy density lithium-ion that the customer knows doesn't drop very much in fact might go up keep us from getting to that hundred dollars a kilowatt hour number okay so that's why there is room for alternative and chemistry's so we'll open up to questions here I see one is Bert you're gonna get a mic there I see yeah I'm like on the coda fuse and I have done the experiment 31 years ago we just implant Triton into a platinum foil until saturated we can't see it from our PS that the attack a proton which is a hundred percent capture efficiency there is no background because it's no nothing in the accelerator there's nothing when you stop the beam when the beam is on you see a huge amount of a fuse and new fuses so I got a lot of neutron radiation but no results zero just glad you know yeah I think you should talk to Florian his if Florian is is at MIT and he's working on an ion beam experiment and I'm sure that he would have we just didn't publish it because we were so disappointed I don't you know there's nothing there's no results yeah hi dr. Chang Rafael Reyes with Peninsula clean energy with a load serving entities for San Mateo County and we have what we believe to be the most aggressive renewable energy target in in California targeting a hundred percent renewable on a time coincident basis by 2025 needless to say with that very aggressive target dealing with long duration batteries is something of special interest and so your discussion about form energy was particularly pertinent so my question I have two questions here one is what you see is the relative time frame around commercialization number one and then can you comment on the non technical barriers to entering the market because you've had now multiple experiences there and part of the part of what we're learning is that you know many technologies don't make it even despite the technical merits because they don't have the financial track record to get into the financing arena to be commercially viable yeah for sure there are a lot of non technical barriers I think you know one thing I would say is that when when you design batteries you at the when you're trying to show that the technology can work you can't design them to an average need you have to design them to a specific project yeah and so you know in something like powers holes or cars you know if you produce something a lot of people can buy that but every utilities application is unique and so our approach is to find the best pilots and to focus on exactly what's needed for that those pilots and to satisfy that exact profile all right so that's so so we do it that's what all data analytics is about is trying to find a you know a very close match between the specific application and the technology and then we'll worry about the next one that that might be slightly different right 20:25 is very soon right yeah and so it has to be scalable I can say that the idea of form for scaling is that it has to be a technology that you don't need to you don't need to have purpose-built factories in order to produce that device ideally it should be something you can produce with an EPC ideally you can even you know assemble it on site so that that's the kind of model that you know we think you really will need in order to be able to scale and to be able to deploy 2025 the one thing that would be really hard to get by 2025 is you know 20 years of life cycling data right okay so and which of course comes to the warranty part of it as well right so you know how do you deal with that I mean and the that's clearly an issue and I think the with something so conservatively what you would try to do is to factor in some reasonable replacement interval and not you know not make a a very aggressive life prediction life expectation so for instance halfway through life maybe you have to replace all the chemicals yeah something like that okay but if it can if it can if can work economically under scenarios like that and you can design something so you know we're not thinking in terms of what we know as a battery today it has to be something that you can scale through very large capacity in a straightforward way without as I said building new factories so that that's kind of approach that we think really speed things along where do you start thinking about design for manufacturing so you've got a little bit of that in there because you have the cost per battery pack yep why as you're looking at these various chemistry's we gotta get it right but then for the implications how do you think about design for manufacture and then maybe you can help us yeah so yeah you're referring to the grid storage yeah so I think that the the type of battery we're thinking envisioning for grid storage may or may not be a flow battery flow batteries have their have their strengths but they also you know there's some things you'd rather not have to do they have to look more like chemical plants they the electrochemistry is the electrochemistry there will be for instance anytime you have electrochemical device there are certain length scales that are determined by transport rates of ions and electrons and so you can't simply make them for instance arbitrarily large right so there has to be some there will be a constraint on the length scale of the of the of the let's call it the stack itself but beyond that I think that you know you really have to think about how do you make it more like a plant Hey and so a form or one of our most recent hires just this week is someone who's the reactor engineer not a nuclear reactor actually a chemical reactor engineer so we're thinking about how do you build batteries to look like chemical reactors and that's how we design for manufacturing yeah I heard an article that somebody said lithium is running out and it's not going to last as long as everybody's building batteries is that true or is that just scare mongering so the cobalt is running out so before we run it long before we run short on lithium the the the greater focus has been on cobalt hey the last analysts report I saw two weeks ago predicts that actually next year the continued rate of Eevee sales that existing COBOL production starts to be insufficient for for what the Eevee Marco will need more production would have to be brought online if you bring down more production that still will run out a few years behind that right so the trend is to first get the cobalt out and so John Goodenough s' cathode was lithium cobalt oxide so the metal part was 100 percent copal today it's 20 percent cobalt in the most widely used Eevee formulation which is nickel manganese cobalt and it's 60 percent nickel 20% cobalt and the version after that only has ten percent cobalt so kind of moving in that direction but even moving that direction there's going to be a cobalt issue the irony was that well everybody was focused on cobalt the nickel price went up and so for the high you know turns out the high nickel content was so-called 8 1 1 only 10 percent cobalt and 80 percent nickel you know we reached the point where now that's more expensive than the the previous higher cobalt one ok so I have to keep track of all of this I think that eventually you know eventually we have to move away from using these transition metals manganese we've got plenty of right but the nickel and cobalt we don't lithium is less of a concern right now than those transition metals so the price of errors remain pretty constant so what about using compressed air storage for storing renewable generated energy is that going to be practical yeah so there are only their I think only two existing installations that do that I shared a platen which there are a number of compare on the ground compressed air storage projects that were Specht out but never built when you look at them they fear they fall fairly closely on top of the the cost of a pumped hydro plant right right now we can't build pump hydro plants the United States either but in China there's a lot of Pumped hydro being developed so fundamentally from the the cost point of view compressed there does not seem crazy to me hey but it's the geological requirements are going to be some limitation on where you can put it I honestly don't don't quite understand why compressed there has not been able to get traction and in places where Pumped hydro has and it's probably just because pump hydro is so much more proven having been you know in first deployed in around the 1930s it would seem like it's easier to do compressed air than you know it would be to do pumped hydro yeah so I'll make an analogy yeah I put I put compressed air pumped hydro and very low cost grid store electrochemical storage all in the same bucket in the sense that they all have a very low cost working fluid right water air or chemicals but they're all very low cost the majority of the cost ends up being in the hardware and that's where it's the system level in the hardware that you start to where the trade-offs and and and the and the head heading Parsons all take place yeah dr. Chen thank you so much for the talk I'm hoping what I'm gonna say will make you feel really well because I happen to know Bob Langer pretty well I'd worked with some of his portfolio so he's the pattern that they generated so much come behind a hundred million dollar fund that he has for his hundred people largest Bao I think the biomedical lab so if you have a chart by per person per capital received patent generated I think you gonna do much better than I do not have a million dollars per researcher which is what you're saying Bob has anytime you know anytime we want to feel inadequate we just think about Bob yes so my question would be around the solid-state lithium-ion cells you mentioned that the capacity of the storage is going up and I'd like to hear what your thoughts are as far as what the expectation should be and also the internal resistance of the cells are gonna go up do you have any ideas by how much yeah so the only ask the second question first which is really is going to come down to the thickness or thinness with which we can produce those solid electrolytes and then there is often an interfacial resistance that you have to figure out and design around so that so right now there's a little hard to predict that because it's very specific to the electrolyte you use and the details of that chemistry right but the I don't think there's an intrinsic reason for internal resistance at the same materials dimensions to be higher in a solid-state cell than in a liquid electrolyte cell in any specific case that could be hired for you know for due to a certain reaction not your but your other question was about what energy that's the improvement should we expect and I think in round numbers you would say a factor of two yeah but that's a that's a moving target because lithium-ion historically has improved eight percent a year and so while we're trying to get lithium metal in lithium ion based on still higher energy density in circulation catheters a notes will still continue to improve do you know if anybody has looked at energy storage like using locomotives running up inclines yes absolutely there's this there's pump water and there's pump rocks and then there's their and trains or you know pump rocks and in fact you know you it turns out that the the pump rock version Softbank recently made a an investment I'm not remembering the name of the company right now so yes people have been thinking about that and it technically it works right the energy density is not very good so you need to pump a lot of you know you need to have it you need a lot of locomotives but if you have a lot of locomotives sitting around and you have a mountain and then tracks could work hard to deploy everywhere though yep on that note we're gonna conclude here Doug here has a few final words and we have a gift so one round of applause first
